@1    = ~Do not waver. This is your moment, what you have fought so long for! Take it...grab hold of what you deserve!~ [ls#blank]
@2    = ~This...this is your choice then? I had thought...had hoped...and yet, I understand. Having fought so long myself for this very thing, I cannot bring myself to blame you for taking it. I fear that the fate of our father will be yours now as well...but I wish you well.~
@3    = ~Ha-ha, victory is yours! You have succeeded where I failed, and yet I could not be more pleased for you. May you tear a streak of blood across the skies that the gods will not soon forget, and I shall do the same on the lands in your name! I am at your command, my goddess.~
@4    = ~So the fate of our sire has finally come to its conclusion, and the tale has ended perhaps as it should. I am...relieved by your choice. I look forward to our future...together, if that is your wish.~
@5    = ~You...no! You fool! After all you claimed I truly believed you were strong enough to take what is yours, but you are nothing more than a coward! I...bah! Finish this so I can get as far from you as possible.~
@6    = ~I must admit I am surprised that I yet remain at your side, though by your wary glances I see you still do not trust me.~ [ls#blank]
@7    = ~Of course I'm wary. It's not like I trust you to keep your oath.~
@8    = ~It hardly matters if I trust you or not - I have your oath.~
@9    = ~Wary glances? You swore an oath, Sarevok, and that's enough for me.~
@10   = ~You have sworn an oath, but if you so much as think about betraying me, I won't hesitate to send you back to the Abyss.~
@11   = ~We may have had our differences in the past, but I don't think you'll betray me.~
@12   = ~Why is it so surprising that I've kept you around?~
@13   = ~I don't know what you're talking about. I don't have any fear of what you might do.~
@14   = ~Should I be wary, Sarevok?~
@15   = ~Yes...the oath. I told you that there was magic in our sire's plane that would enforce an oath. And it is true...I can feel its power even now. Oaths are binding when made in such a place.~
@16   = ~But still, I am curious. Regardless of any oath you might have had me take, why did you agree to take me with you? You have no remaining grudges from our earlier matches?~
@17   = ~No, not really. You paid for what you did.~
@18   = ~You're useful. *That* is why you are here.~
@19   = ~I have plenty of grudges, but you have your uses.~
@20   = ~You're no match for me in combat anymore, Sarevok.~
@21   = ~I...paid for it. You do not still feel anger over what I did to your foster father?~
@22   = ~Are you trying to upset me by bringing up Gorion?~
@23   = ~No.  You're not the same man, are you?~
@24   = ~I will never forgive you.  But no, I'm not angry about it.~
@25   = ~I never really cared much for Gorion, anyway.~
@26   = ~Perhaps.  But I already took my revenge.  Now you get the benefit of the doubt.~
@27   = ~Why ever would I try such a thing, dear sister?~
@28   = ~I don't have any anger anymore, no.  You're not the same man, are you?~

@32   = ~I also couldn't pass up the chance to fight beside you for a change.~
@33   = ~Besides, you might prove to be interesting company.~
@34   = ~Enough introspection. Let's go.~
@35   = ~I should have expected as much.~
@36   = ~Yes, I can understand the use of a skilled warrior...especially one you have little cause to fear.~
@37   = ~You have grown in power, so I do not expect you to fear me as you once may have. But I do expect the lack of trust, the suspicion that I might betray you. If I were you, I would feel so.~
@38   = ~It eats away at me, then, as to why you would agree to take me with you and not force some form of compliance from me through an oath.  I told you that oaths had real power in our father's realm.~
@39   = ~I would never believe anything you say anyway, so what would be the point?~
@40   = ~I take you with me because you may be of use.~
@41   = ~You're here on your own recognizance.  Screw it up and you can always die again.~
@42   = ~I don't believe in enslaving the wills of others.  Your destiny is your own business.~

@46   = ~You're here on your own recognizance.  Screw up and you can always die again.~
@47   = ~Because everyone deserves another chance, Sarevok.  Even you.~
@48   = ~ So you allow me to make my own destiny by your side, trusting I will not betray you...why? Your vengeance aside, why would I not do so, if I thought I could gain an advantage?~
@49   = ~You probably will.  I will just deal with it then, is all.~
@50   = ~I'm willing to take the risk. You may prove useful to me.~
@51   = ~My vengeance will have to be enough.~
@52   = ~You paid for what you did.  You're a new man, free to make new mistakes, if you wish.~
@53   = ~You might.  But everyone gets a second chance, Sarevok.  Even you.~
@54   = ~Yes, I can understand the use of a skilled warrior...especially one you have little cause to fear. It is the lack of restraint that confuses me, when it is available.~
@55   = ~Maybe I wanted to get to know you as well...see if you really are the heartless bastard you seemed to be.~
@56   = ~And, pray tell, what profound conclusions have you reached, dear sister?~
@57   = ~I don't think you're the monster you wish you were.~
@58   = ~I'd rather keep my theories to myself for now.~

@65   = ~You fight well.~ [ls#blank]
@66   = ~Thank you, I suppose.~
@67   = ~Was that a compliment?~
@68   = ~I know. My power has grown, though it's nothing compared to the power I will attain.~
@69   = ~You don't do so bad yourself.~
@70   = ~I don't care about your opinion, Sarevok. Leave me be.~
@71   = ~An observation.~
@72   = ~Did you expect any less?~
@73   = ~You have changed much, at least on the surface. You seem calm, at ease with this life. But tell me, are you still a cowering little girl on the inside?~
@74   = ~I may have changed, but you clearly have not. You're still a complete bastard.~
@75   = ~If you must know, I do get scared. I think any sane person does, and I don't feel bad about it.~
@76   = ~No, I'm not. That girl died long ago.~
@77   = ~Yes, Sarevok, I'm terrified. In fact, I think you'll have to carry me from now on because I'm too scared to keep going.~
@78   = ~Get away from me, you filthy bastard!~
@79   = ~Hah! That is no insult coming from you.~
@80   = ~Coward.~
@81   = ~You should thank me, <CHARNAME>. If not for my intervention, you would still be hiding behind those monastery walls.~
@82   = ~If not for you, Gorion would still be alive!~
@83   = ~I wasn't hiding! I would have found a way to leave by now.~
@84   = ~You're right. Thank you so much for destroying the closest thing I've ever had to family and a home.~
@85   = ~I owe you nothing. Everything I've accomplished has been on my own.~
@86   = ~I miss those monastery walls, Sarevok.~
@87   = ~I thanked you already - the day I struck you down.~
@88   = ~Get away from me you sick bastard.~
@89   = ~Don't be a fool. The old man was protecting a Child of Bhaal - two of them in fact - and if not I, then someone else would have claimed his life eventually.~
@90   = ~Bah, those things are nothing but burdens to one of the Children, <CHARNAME>.~
@91   = ~Hah, you arrogant fool! Even I had to stand on the shoulders of others to reach as high as I did, and even then it was nowhere near enough!~
@92   = ~Why? They did not protect you, <CHARNAME>. They were your cage, nothing more.~
@93   = ~Hah! Perhaps you did.~
@94   = ~I am curious...what do you think you would have done with your life had I not come for you? Do you imagine peace and tranquility, I wonder?~
@95   = ~Is it insight that you seek, Sarevok? Perhaps you question your past choices and where they led you? Or perhaps your only concern is learning more about what motivates me.~
@96   = ~Do you think me such a fool? There is a very good chance you are asking me this question only to use the information against me. Though perhaps there's a part of you that regrets your past choices.~
@97   = ~Why do you ask?~
@98   = ~I don't know. I've never really thought about it.~
@99   = ~I have some idea, but it's none of your business.~
@100  = ~Probably the same thing I am now.~
@101  = ~Doing my best to avoid traveling, killing and anything to do with Bhaal most likely.~
@102  = ~My life without you? I can't imagine such a nightmarish reality.~
@103  = ~Keep your curiosity to yourself from now on. I have no time for idle prattle.~
@104  = ~As I said, I am curious.~
@105  = ~I don't trust you enough to talk about such things with you.~
@106  = ~Perhaps you should take the time.~
@107  = ~I suppose that is not surprising.~
@108  = ~I am glad you realize the truth. Perhaps you are wiser than I gave you credit for, <CHARNAME>.~
@109  = ~That would be a fool's ideal. You are one of the Children, <CHARNAME>. You cannot escape your blood.~
@110  = ~Jest if you must, <CHARNAME>, but the question remains, and you would be wise to think on it.~
@111  = ~Is that what you believe? And which would you say motivates me, my dear sister?~
@112  = ~I don't care either way. If you're looking for perspective you've come to the wrong person, and as for gaining intimate knowledge about me...well, you'll have to work harder for that I'm afraid.~
@113  = ~Perhaps a bit of both.~
@114  = ~I hope you're looking for perspective, but that's probably wishful thinking on my part.~
@115  = ~Perspective perhaps, but I don't see why you bother.~
@116  = ~You're likely trying to figure me out so you can better get what you want from me in the long run, but I'm willing to risk that and hope you change your mind.~
@117  = ~You're likely trying to figure me out so you can better get what you want from me in the long run, and I have to tell you, that angers me greatly, brother.~
@118  = ~I haven't the faintest idea, Sarevok, and I'm not sure you know either.~
@119  = ~I appreciate your candor. Perhaps I will have to work harder.~
@120  = ~Perhaps.~
@121  = ~Why bother indeed.~
@122  = ~You risk quite a bit, <CHARNAME>.~
@123  = ~Can you blame me? Would you not do the same in my position?~
@124  = ~It appears the seeds that our sire sowed long ago are about to come to fruition.  For good or ill, the issue will be finally resolved very soon.~ [ls#blank]
@125  = ~You believed that before and were proven wrong.~
@126  = ~You sound jealous.~
@127  = ~This isn't how you expected it to be, is it?~
@128  = ~It seems so.~
@129  = ~I wish I could just hide away from all this...~
@130  = ~Don't be a fool - things are different now. Surely you realize that.~
@131  = ~I once believed I was the one to fulfill Alaundo's prophecy...but now...~
@132  = ~But you cannot, and you know it.~
@133  = ~When the end comes, my use to you will be over. Tell me, <CHARNAME>, what do you intend to do with me then?~
@134  = ~You're free to go, if that is your wish.~
@135  = ~What? Why is that my decision?~
@136  = ~I haven't thought too much about it.~
@137  = ~I cannot just let you go, not if you intend to cause evil again.~
@138  = ~I intend to kill you again, of course.~
@139  = ~I offered my services to you because I knew you would require my aid and my knowledge, and because I knew yours would be the path of power. But I also cannot foresee you allowing me my freedom.~
@140  = ~You are under the mistaken impression that I give a damn about what you do, Sarevok. Make your own choices.~
@141  = ~Then take a moment and do so.~
@142  = ~You would allow me to leave? We would just part ways, and I would be free to carry out whatever plans I wish, no matter what they might be?~
@143  = ~If that is your desire, then yes.~
@144  = ~Your destiny is yours alone, Sarevok. Make the same mistakes if you must.~
@145  = ~Do whatever you want, Sarevok. It has nothing to do with me.~
@146  = ~Not if you intend to do evil. Then I would be forced to stop you.~
@147  = ~What gave you the impression that I give a damn about you or your plans?~
@148  = ~And do you believe I have another choice?~
@149  = ~Another choice than being evil? Always.~
@150  = ~It all depends on whether or not you want to end up in the same place, Sarevok.~
@151  = ~You always have another choice. I will not stop you.~
@152  = ~I suppose not. You cannot change a man's nature.~
@153  = ~I could care less. Do as you like.~
@154  = ~But I *am* evil, <CHARNAME>. I intend to gain power for myself, as I once did, although my exact plans will be different. Did you assume I would do otherwise?~
@155  = ~No. I suppose you're free to make the same mistakes as before.~
@156  = ~I assumed that perhaps you had decided to live your life differently.~
@157  = ~I assumed that you would know better. I would be forced to kill you then, I suppose.~
@158  = ~True. I guess I will have to kill you again, after all.~
@159  = ~I see. It is to be a final murder, in honor of our sire, is it?~
@160  = ~It won't be murder. It'll be justice.~
@161  = ~If it will stop you from spreading your evil, yes.~
@162  = ~I don't know. I will have to see when the time comes.~
@163  = ~Absolutely. Why not?~
@164  = ~Ah, yes. The delusion of righteousness. So be it.~
@165  = ~Hah, it seems I have not given you enough credit, <CHARNAME>.~
@166  = ~Perhaps I wouldn't mind traveling more with you, though, when this is over. I am not as adverse to your company as I expected to be.~
@167  = ~There is little point in thinking too far ahead. I could die tomorrow, you could die tomorrow, so it's simply better to live in the now.~
@168  = ~I might consider letting you be my servant when I attain godhood. You can feed me grapes and fan your goddess with palm fronds.~
@169  = ~Let's get moving.~
@170  = ~Truly? I am curious, then...what did you expect?~
@171  = ~I expected you to be a bloodthirsty, power-driven brute. But there's more to you than that.~
@172  = ~I'm not really sure, but I certainly didn't expect to enjoy your presence...and, some of the time anyway, I do.~
@173  = ~I think you misunderstand. You are as I expected you to be, but I did not think I would be able to tolerate you. And thus far I have.~
@174  = ~It doesn't really matter what I expected. Just be satisfied with the knowledge that you make a decent travelling companion.~
@175  = ~I don't think I want to tell you.~
@176  = ~That's none of your concern.~
@177  = ~Interesting. I admit, you are not what I expected either.~
@178  = ~As you would have it.~
@179  = ~You spare no thought at all for the future? You are an odd woman, <CHARNAME>.~
@180  = ~(snort) I would likely make a poor servant in that capacity.~
@181  = ~Come aside with me, <CHARNAME>. I must speak with you.~ [ls#blank]
@182  = ~Of course. What's wrong?~
@183  = ~You look anxious.~
@184  = ~What is it now?~
@185  = ~Not right now, Sarevok.~
@186  = ~This is too important to put off.~
@187  = ~The end draws near, you know this. Alaundo's Prophecy is ready to be fulfilled. I have a proposal for you, but first there is something I must know. Are you prepared to take what is rightfully yours should you have the chance?~
@188  = ~Whoa! How do you know the prophecy is about me?~
@189  = ~If you're asking what I think you're asking, the answer is no, Sarevok. I have no interest in anything Bhaal has to offer.~
@190  = ~I have no interest in Bhaal's power, if that is what you mean.~
@191  = ~I...I'm not sure...~
@192  = ~Perhaps I am interested in attaining power, but it's likely not for the same reasons you had in the past.~
@193  = ~Hah, I've been prepared for a long, long time. Soon, all of Bhaal's former power will be mine!~
@194  = ~I don't see how this is any of your business.~
@195  = ~I never said I did.~
@196  = ~Hah, I've been prepared for a long time. Soon, all of Bhaal's former power will be mine!~
@197  = ~Perhaps it is not, but I ask all the same.~
@198  = ~Then let me put it to you more clearly; it's none of your business, so leave me alone!~
@199  = ~But...why? Why would you turn away power, power which is yours by right?!~
@200  = ~It's not power, Sarevok, it's a burden! And I have no interest in being tied down by it.~
@201  = ~I have never wanted power, Sarevok! All I want is a normal life, a chance to live in peace for once.~
@202  = ~I already have power, and it was enough to defeat even you. I don't need the castoff of some dead god.~
@203  = ~I...I don't know...~
@204  = ~Bah! You are weak to hide from this chance! I was a fool to expect more from you!~
@205  = ~You're right, you are a fool - a fool for refusing to see the truth! All of your 'power' couldn't save you, Sarevok, and yet you still run blindly down the same path!~
@206  = ~I don't care if you think I'm weak. I'm not changing my mind - I want nothing to do with Bhaal or his power!~
@207  = ~Why don't you just leave then?~
@208  = ~And I was fool to expect more from you it seems.~
@209  = ~Enough! I will not be lectured by you!~
@210  = ~You are as much a waste as the rest of Bhaal's cowering bastard Children!~
@211  = ~I...no. Not yet.~
@212  = ~Someday you will regret this decision, <CHARNAME>.~
@213  = ~I have sworn my oath, and I shall not break it.~
@214  = ~Why do you hesitate? What could possibly convince you to deny yourself this right if it is offered to you?~
@215  = ~I don't think I'm ready for this, Sarevok...~
@216  = ~I don't want that life. I want to eat and drink and love and grow old and die someday, Sarevok!~
@217  = ~Maybe you're right...maybe I should stop denying myself...~
@218  = ~But you could be, <CHARNAME>! Imagine all you could have, what you could become!~
@219  = ~No, I don't want Bhaal's power. I want to live my own life!~
@220  = ~Let me help you. Imagine it, <CHARNAME>! Together we could advance across the Realms, an unstoppable force with an army at your command! You would be the ultimate terror and I would be your iron right hand, to rule over all!~
@221  = ~Whoa, whoa, what in the hells makes you think I'd have any interest in being ‘the ultimate terror'? Forget it, Sarevok! I'm not interested in any of this!~
@222  = ~You don't understand. I would take the power, yes, but I would not harm others with it. I have no desire to be like Bhaal.~
@223  = ~I still don't know...that sounds like a lot of responsibility, and...~
@224  = ~Fascinating. Is it even possible...could I become a god?~
@225  = ~Very interesting. But what if I wanted you as something more than my 'right hand'?~
@226  = ~Listen to me. I expect no greatness from myself, <CHARNAME>. You should know that the plans I once had to become the new Lord of Murder died with the loss of my taint, but you can still have that chance!~
@227  = ~Forget it. I don't want that life.~
@228  = ~And end up like you? No thanks. I'll take my chances on mortality.~
@229  = ~I admit, your words intrigue me. I shall think on it.~
@230  = ~I admit, I do not know for certain. Still, it is an intriguing possibility, and you cannot allow it to pass you by should it come your way.~
@231  = ~I don't want to be a god, Sarevok. I just want to live a normal life.~
@232  = ~Your words intrigue me, Sarevok. I shall think on it.~
@233  = ~I hope that you shall.~
@234  = ~Speak plainly.~
@235  = ~My bedroll is very cold at night. Your body is very warm. Is that plain enough for you?~
@236  = ~Do not think I am blind, Sarevok. I have seen how you look at me, and it is not with the eyes of a brother.~
@237  = ~Never mind. I shall think on your words, Sarevok.~
@238  = ~Hah, your imagination has run away with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@239  = ~If you desire a paramour, then you would be wise to search elsewhere for someone more accommodating.~
@240  = ~You will accommodate me, Sarevok, if you wish to share in my power.~
@241  = ~I desire *you*, Sarevok.~
@242  = ~Perhaps that would be wise, but I have never claimed to be wise.~
@243  = ~Perhaps you are right...still, I shall think on your words.~
@244  = ~If that is truly your desire, then seek me out when next we rest. Until then, think on what I have said.~
@245  = ~(For the last several hours, Sarevok has been watching you more closely than usual, though he is trying to be discreet for once. A few times he looks as if he is about to speak, but he never does.)~
@246  = ~(His eyes are thoughtful, perhaps confused, and even a touch angry at times. Something about his expression tells you that even if you asked, he wouldn't tell you what's on his mind. Still, his dark eyes follow you, as if memorizing your every move.)~
@247  = ~I do not understand you, <CHARNAME>. You have the chance for so much power right at your fingertips, and yet you would let it slip away!~ [ls#blank]
@248  = ~It's not as easy to gain as you imply, and the cost is hardly worth it. Look at yourself for example.~
@249  = ~These fingertips right here? All I see is blood and calluses. That's not exactly how I imagine power looks.~
@250  = ~Power corrupts, Sarevok.~
@251  = ~Are you *still* going on about this?~
@252  = ~You know what - I've had enough of you. Just leave me alone!~
@253  = ~I am well aware of my own losses, and I hardly need you to remind me of them.~
@254  = ~Then you and I have very different definitions of power.~
@255  = ~Such a waste. I should say you are a coward...except...~
@256  = ~Except...?~
@257  = ~You can think what you want - it doesn't matter to me.~
@258  = ~If you think me a coward, I'll be glad to send you back to the Abyss once more, Sarevok.~
@259  = ~You're right. You don't understand me, and you never will, so just stop trying.~
@260  = ~So you say, but I think it does matter to you. Why else would I still be here?~
@261  = ~Very well.~
@262  = ~I have seen you in battle, both as an enemy and as an ally, and I know you are no coward. But that is exactly why I don't understand! You *know* what could be at stake, how powerful you could become!~
@263  = ~Maybe...maybe you're right. Maybe I'm a fool to deny myself this chance...~
@264  = ~I do know...and maybe, someday, if I'm faced with the choice, I'll change my mind, but as of now, I'm not looking for power.~
@265  = ~I *do* fear Bhaal's power, Sarevok. It only has the power to destroy.~
@266  = ~I do not long for power as you do. I'm not sure how else to explain it.~
@267  = ~Do you truly wish to understand me?~
@268  = ~You do not even know your own mind? Are you incapable of making your own decisions? Or are you simply so weak that the slightest breeze moves you?~
@269  = ~I don't know. What you say makes a lot of sense...~
@270  = ~I was merely saying that maybe, someday, if I'm faced with the choice, I'll change my mind, but as of now, I'm not looking for power.~
@271  = ~I said, 'Maybe I'm a fool' - not that I'd changed my mind! I don't want power, Sarevok, plain and simple.~
@272  = ~I have no desire to entertain the insecurities of the weak and unsure. We should get moving.~
@273  = ~Fool! Must you always think so narrowly?~
@274  = ~I...no, I will not answer your questions while you yet refuse to answer mine!~
@275  = ~Why, *why* would you pass up the chance to take Bhaal's power if you can?~
@276  = ~You will not like the answer, but very well. Bhaal is dead. You were dead. Every other Bhaalspawn who ever attempted to attain godhood is *dead*. What then should I assume will happen to me?~
@277  = ~Don't you ever give it a rest? I'm not like you, Sarevok! I do not want that power!~
@278  = ~I want a normal life, Sarevok. Is that so hard to understand?~
@279  = ~Someone far wiser than I once said 'With great power comes great responsibility'. Do I really strike you as someone who'd be good with that amount of responsibility?~
@280  = ~I have done just fine so far without this great wealth of power you seem to imagine is waiting for me. I see no reason to change up a good thing.~
@281  = ~Even if I accepted such power, I would not use it as you would. I have no desire to rule over others.~
@282  = ~Just because Bhaal's tainted blood flows in my veins does not mean I must lust for evil! Stop trying to challenge that!~
@283  = ~I may revel in blood and murder more than the average girl, but that doesn't mean I want to chase after some foolish 'destiny' and fulfill a 'prophecy'. I have my own plans, Sarevok.~
@284  = ~You should have more faith in your own abilities. But...I see your point.~
@285  = ~Bah, you would be a peasant when you could be a god! And I wonder what peasant would not trade places with you in an instant.~
@286  = ~I cannot argue with what is so obviously true, but it is a pathetic excuse nonetheless.~
@287  = ~If you have come so far on your own abilities, image what you could accomplish with even more power!~
@288  = ~You cannot even give me a reason, yet you remain stubborn.~
@289  = ~(sigh) I am no closer to understanding you, <CHARNAME>. The way you think...it is foolishness!~
@290  = ~Don't give up. I have faith that you'll see things differently someday.~
@291  = ~I hope you keep trying. To understand me, that is.~
@292  = ~Heh, not surprising considering I don't understand myself half the time.~
@293  = ~Maybe I don't want you to understand me.~
@294  = ~Then give up already.~
@295  = ~Why? Why do you care?~
@296  = ~Isn't it obvious? I have feelings for you, Sarevok.~
@297  = ~I don't know. I just do.~
@298  = ~You know the answer.~
@299  = ~Because I don't want to see you make the same mistakes again.~
@300  = ~I don't. So stop trying already.~
@301  = ~If that is true, then why bother explaining yourself to me at all?~
@302  = ~I don't know.~
@303  = ~You'll never understand me, so stop trying already.~
@304  = ~I...I see.~
@305  = ~(sigh) Women.~
@306  = ~(During a brief rest, you notice Sarevok going through the moves of a complex combat exercise some distance from you.)~
@307  = ~(Watch him.)~
@308  = ~I usually depend on my spells, but would you teach me some of this?~
@309  = ~I usually use my hands for battle, but perhaps you could show me a thing or two about your techniques.~
@310  = ~That looks pretty useful. Could you teach me how to do that?~
@311  = ~Enough of that. Let's get going.~
@312  = ~(Ignore him.)~
@313  = ~As you wish.~
@314  = ~None of my combat knowledge will serve you in battle. It would be worthless to try to teach you at this point. Stick to your magic.~
@315  = ~Do you mind if I watch you anyway?~
@316  = ~Don't give me that - show me! I can handle it!~
@317  = ~Fine then. Let's get moving.~
@318  = ~(sigh) We are wasting time. Let us just get going.~
@319  = ~I could, but my training techniques utilize melee weapons.~
@320  = ~Oh. Well, in that case, do you mind if I watch anyway?~
@321  = ~That's fine. I can use more than my hands to fight.~
@322  = ~Never mind then. We should get moving.~
@323  = ~I suppose there is no harm in showing you what I know. Very well. Prepare yourself.~
@324  = ~Okay, let's do this!~
@325  = ~Ready when you are.~
@326  = ~On second thought, I'd rather just watch you. If you don't mind.~
@327  = ~Forget it. We shouldn't be standing around here anyway. Let's go.~
@328  = ~If that is your wish.~
@329  = ~(Sarevok raises his weapon above his head in a solid, two-handed grip, then holds the pose. The muscles on his neck and arms bulge under the weapon's weight, but he doesn't seem to be straining.)~
@330  = ~(Suddenly the blade plunges into a devastating downward slash, and Sarevok twists his enormous frame at a dizzying speed to evade imaginary attacks. He grunts as he throws his entire body behind a brutal thrust toward his nonexistent enemy, then spins the weapon into a flurry of deadly blows.)~
@331  = ~(With a last roar of effort, he lashes out in a wide, half-circle cut that would flatten anyone near him. Holding the weapon almost horizontal from his wide chest, Sarevok breathes deeply and exhales slowly, his muscles relaxing.)~
@332  = ~(He raises his dark, unreadable eyes to meet yours. He hasn't even broken a sweat.)~
@333  = ~(Smile at him.) Impressive.~
@334  = ~Showing off for me, hmm?~
@335  = ~I'm glad you're on my side this time, Sarevok.~
@336  = ~Pfft, I could do that...~
@337  = ~Are you finished wasting time? We need to get moving.~
@338  = ~(Sarevok raises one eyebrow.) I am glad you enjoyed yourself.~
@339  = ~And why would I need to do that? You have a hard time keeping your eyes from me as it is.~
@340  = ~(Sarevok barks out a rueful laugh.) I am certain you are.~
@341  = ~Hah, then I expect you to prove it the next time we do battle with a real enemy.~
@342  = ~Come. Let us not continue to waste time.~
@343  = ~Begin thus. (Sarevok raises his weapon above his head in a solid, two-handed grip, then holds the pose. The muscles on his neck and arms bulge under the weapon's weight, but he doesn't seem be to straining.)~
@344  = ~(Mimick his pose.)~
@345  = ~You know...on second thought, maybe we should just get moving.~
@346  = ~Forget this. Let's go.~
@347  = ~(You heft your weapon and hold the position as easily as he does.)~
@348  = ~Good. Now...~
@349  = ~(Suddenly the blade plunges into a devastating downward slash, and Sarevok twists his enormous frame at a dizzying speed to evade imaginary attacks.~
@350  = ~(Mirror his quick movements.)~
@351  = ~(With deft ease, you keep pace with his brutally efficient movements.)~
@352  = ~Well done. Now quickly...~
@353  = ~(He grunts as he throws his entire body behind a brutal thrust toward his nonexistent enemy, then spins the weapon into a flurry of deadly blows.)~
@354  = ~(Throw yourself into the same set of movements.)~
@355  = ~(At the end of the furious combination of blows, you suddenly feel the pressure of Sarevok's back pressed against yours. On instinct, the pair of you spin in tandem, your weapons lashing out in a wide, circular cut that would flatten anyone near you.)~
@356  = ~(Sarevok steps sharply away from you, an intense, curious look in his dark eyes, and breathes deeply and exhales slowly, his muscles relaxing. He hasn't even broken a sweat, but he can't seem to take his eyes from you.)~
@357  = ~(Smile at him.) That was great!~
@358  = ~Um...that was...uh...~
@359  = ~Hah, it looks like all this fighting together has done us some good.~
@360  = ~Pfft, see? I don't need your help! I'm amazing!~
@361  = ~Well, that was a waste of time. Let's go.~
@362  = ~(Sarevok shakes his head, but the corner of his mouth twitches suspiciously.) You surprise me, <CHARNAME>. Well done.~
@363  = ~Unexpected. We fight well together.~
@364  = ~(You do your best to keep up with his brutally efficient movements, but you trip over your own feet and nearly land on your face.)~
@365  = ~(sigh) You are going to hurt yourself. Try this...~
@366  = ~(Your movements are easily as powerful as Sarevok's, but they lack his grace and speed.)~
@367  = ~(He stops and eyes you with a frown.) You are strong, <CHARNAME>, but you have the dexterity of an overfed cow.~
@368  = ~Gee, you really know how to make a girl feel good about herself.~
@369  = ~You are such a jerk!~
@370  = ~Excuse me?!~
@371  = ~I've never been especially light on my feet, but I think I make up for it in other areas.~
@372  = ~(Sarevok's voice is laced with mockery.) Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I was unaware that you needed constant hand-holding.~
@373  = ~Well, I do! (Hold your hand out to him impudently.)~
@374  = ~Hah, I don't, but you still could try to be less of a bastard sometimes.~
@375  = ~A little respect wouldn't kill you, Sarevok. I *have* killed you before, in case you don't recall.~
@376  = ~(Sarevok shakes his head and turns away, but you're almost certain there is a smirk on his face.)~
@377  = ~I do. Perhaps you should remind yourself how many times you turn your back to me in battle, and how many times I have saved your hide. Respect works both ways.~
@378  = ~(You heft your weapon, but your arms shake under the strain of the demanding position.)~
@379  = ~Better. Now quickly...~
@380  = ~(Your movements are fast and graceful, but they lack the raw power of Sarevok's blows.)~
@381  = ~(He stops and eyes you with a frown.) You are quick, <CHARNAME>, but even a jelly could pin you in a contest of strength.~
@382  = ~I've never been especially strong, but I think I make up for it in other areas.~
@383  = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, there is nothing I can teach you. How you have even managed to survive thus far is a mystery to me. Let us go.~
@384  = ~If power is not your goal, then what? What do you intend to do with yourself?~ [ls#blank]
@385  = ~Before I answer, let me ask you this: What would you do in my place?~
@386  = ~Find a quiet little place to settle down, I suppose. Live in peace, Sarevok.~
@387  = ~Probably continue to travel and adventure. This life suits me, that much is certain.~
@388  = ~Anywhere there's gold to be had, there I will be!~
@389  = ~Perhaps I'll conquer a small nation somewhere, raise an army, plunder my neighboring lands. You know, the usual.~
@390  = ~I doubt I'll live through this, so what's the point in talking about the future?~
@391  = ~I see. Such things have never appealed to me, but I suppose a part of me understands the allure.~
@392  = ~I agree. You seem unusually suited for this life.~
@393  = ~(sigh) And yet you deny Bhaal's power.~
@394  = ~Whatever it is you choose to do with yourself, don't you worry that one day you will regret denying your heritage? Do you have no fear that you will look back and curse yourself for what you let slip away?~
@395  = ~I will be too busy living my life to wallow in regret, Sarevok.~
@396  = ~Perhaps I will, but that is just something I will have to live with.~
@397  = ~I probably will, but I still don't want the power.~
@398  = ~No, because I'm certain this is the right path for me.~
@399  = ~If that day should come, I'll deal with it then. There's no point in dwelling on what might be.~
@400  = ~You don't believe me?~
@401  = ~You don't sound convinced.~
@402  = ~I believe you mean what you say. But that does not make it truth.~
@403  = ~It was so much easier when I thought you nothing more than a fool...~
@404  = ~You continually succeed where I have failed. The world presses down on you, but you are not crushed. Every instinct I have screams at me that you cannot survive much longer, that everything you hold dear will vanish and your failure will be more complete than mine ever was!~
@405  = ~You should know by now that I won't fail.~
@406  = ~What a wonderful thing to wish on someone.~
@407  = ~Hah! Still bitter over your defeat I see. Well, you won't get your wish, Sarevok.~
@408  = ~Is that what you hope will happen?~
@409  = ~I sense a 'but' coming here...~
@410  = ~I am not talking about my hopes or desires, <CHARNAME>, I'm talking about what is real!~
@411  = ~A person who does not have power is weak, and you are worse than that! You do not even desire what could easily be yours! You should have failed by now!~
@412  = ~But...you have not. You have, in fact flourished.~
@413  = ~Can't you understand? I don't want to believe that your way can work!~
@414  = ~But you do. Don't you?~
@415  = ~Then don't, Sarevok, and end up exactly where you always end up!~
@416  = ~Sometimes we must put aside what we want in favor of what is right, Sarevok.~
@417  = ~I do understand. If I were in your place...I can imagine how hard it would be.~
@418  = ~You're pathetic! You can't even admit that I'm right and you've been a fool!~
@419  = ~I...no...I do not know...bah!~
@420  = ~I have learned from my mistakes, <CHARNAME>, no matter how it may seem to you. I will never end up on the losing side again.~
@421  = ~(snort) Now you sound like your foster father.~
@422  = ~No, <CHARNAME>. I do not think you can.~
@423  = ~It has yet to be proven who is right, dear sister, and you should be wary of whom you call a fool.~
@424  = ~I should never have brought this up. Let's go.~
@425  = ~No, wait. I'm glad you brought it up. I want to help you.~
@426  = ~If that is what you wish.~
@427  = ~Yes, thank you for wasting my precious time once again.~
@428  = ~Help me? In what way?~
@429  = ~Any way you need, Sarevok.~
@430  = ~I'm here for you if you need to talk again.~
@431  = ~I don't want to see you end up on the same path again.~
@432  = ~Interpret it any way you wish, Sarevok.~
@433  = ~Hah, that is not the kind of open-ended suggestion you should make to a man, <CHARNAME>, least of all a man like me. It could prove...dangerous. Let us move on.~
@434  = ~I see. I...appreciate that, I suppose.~
@435  = ~You mean if I had another chance to ascend? I thought the answer would be obvious, though perhaps you merely wish to hear the words from my lips. I would let nothing stand in my way of taking Bhaal's throne for myself.~
@436  = ~You don't sound as confident as you once did.~
@437  = ~Have you really learned nothing? Surely you must realize by now that you cannot live your life on blind ambition as you have in the past!~
@438  = ~Why?~
@439  = ~(sigh)~
@440  = ~That's what I figured.~
@441  = ~Perhaps not, but I mean the words nonetheless.~
@442  = ~I have my reasons.~
@443  = ~Have I disappointed you?~
@444  = ~Yes you have, and for the last time. I don't know why I wasted my time trying to help you in the first place. Get away from me!~
@445  = ~No, Sarevok. Haven't you learned anything in our time together so far? Traveling those old paths...you'll be throwing your life away!~
@446  = ~Yes I am disappointed, and eventually I will lose patience with you! Haven't you learned anything from your time in the Abyss? You'll only end up there again if you don't change something!~
@447  = ~Why do I feel like nothing I say will ever get through to you?~
@448  = ~(Sarevok moves up beside you, a frown on his face as he eyes your pack critically.) Stop a moment, <CHARNAME>.~
@449  = ~Okay. What's wrong?~
@450  = ~No, Sarevok, there's no time for delays.~
@451  = ~If you insist.~
@452  = ~Don't be difficult.~
@453  = ~(Sarevok's hand slide under the bottom of your pack, lifting the weight from your shoulders as he makes some adjustments. Occasionally his hand brushes the small of your back, but his face is very serious and he's clearly focused on his task.)~
@454  = ~(After a few moments, his hands move up under the straps of the pack, shifting their position against your shoulders. With a satisfied nod, he steps away, letting the weight resettle against your back. Though you know he hasn't removed a single item, for some reason the burden feels lighter and the weight is more bearable than before.)~
@455  = ~(Smile at Sarevok.) Thank you. That feels much better.~
@456  = ~That was very nice of you, Sarevok.~
@457  = ~You'll have to teach me how to do that.~
@458  = ~You could have just offered to carry it for me, you know.~
@459  = ~Pfft, it was fine the way it was!~
@460  = ~(Sarevok raises one eyebrow.) My pleasure.~
@461  = ~Are you too weak to carry your own possessions, <CHARNAME>?~
@462  = ~You should learn how to pack and carry the weight properly so that it does not impair you in battle. I could show you how when we have a moment, if you wish.~
@463  = ~(Sarevok moves away without giving you a chance to reply. As you continue on your way, the now comfortable pressure of the pack against your back, and the way his eyes follow you frequently, leave you to wonder on his abrupt act of kindness.)~
@464  = ~Do you have any regrets, <CHARNAME>?~ [ls#blank]
@465  = ~In regards to what?~
@466  = ~Of course. Doesn't everyone?~
@467  = ~I've never thought about it. The past isn't really worth dwelling on.~
@468  = ~Of course not. Only a fool regrets.~
@469  = ~Anything. Murders, betrayals...lovers. Life in general.~
@470  = ~I've never really thought about it. The past isn't really worth dwelling on.~
@471  = ~I agree.~
@472  = ~I look back on my life, my mistakes, my...failures, and for some reason I cannot feel remorse for the things I have done. Despite dying, losing everything, I cannot bring myself to regret the choices that led to it.~
@473  = ~What a horrible thing to say! What of Gorion? You murdered the only father I ever knew, and countless other innocents for your ambition!~
@474  = ~I'm stunned, Sarevok, really. No, seriously, I'd have expected you to be weeping like a babe by now.~
@475  = ~Why not?~
@476  = ~I think I understand what you mean.~
@477  = ~Of course you don't. That would imply that you have a conscience, which we've clearly established you lack.~
@478  = ~Do you not even wish to ask me why? Have you already judged me?~
@479  = ~Yes I have, and I want nothing to do with you! I don't know why I wasted my time on you in the first place.~
@480  = ~I...I suppose I will hear you out. Why don't you have any regrets, Sarevok?~
@481  = ~By all means, enlighten me.~
@482  = ~Had I not done the things I have done, I would not be here now. With you.~
@483  = ~Whoa...was that a confession? Because it sure sounded like a confession to me.~
@484  = ~I never thought I'd hear you say something like that.~
@485  = ~I know exactly what you mean.~
@486  = ~I'm glad you're here with me, Sarevok.~
@487  = ~What exactly do you mean by 'with you'?~
@488  = ~But...all those deaths...you killed so many people...~
@489  = ~Not exactly.~
@490  = ~Indeed.~
@491  = ~Guilt serves no one, <CHARNAME>. Wallowing in the past will gain me nothing.~
@492  = ~I have been considering everything you told me. I have begun to rethink things. I think perhaps...perhaps it may be a good thing.~
@493  = ~I am not the man I once was...but that man is the reason I am here now.~
@494  = ~And that is why you have no regrets?~
@495  = ~I'm glad, Sarevok. For the changes and for you being here.~
@496  = ~When you put it that way, you sound a little insane.~
@497  = ~I understand. I suppose I'm grateful to the 'old you' as well, though I can't say I'm sad to see him go.~
@498  = ~I'm happy for you. You have suffered much in life, and in return, brought horrible suffering on others. Perhaps now is the time for you and the world to make amends to one another.~
@499  = ~I kind of liked the man you were...~
@500  = ~It doesn't seem right somehow, Sarevok, that you can so easily shrug off everything you've done and pretend like you're a changed man.~
@501  = ~Exactly.~
@502  = ~Perhaps I am. I certainly feel that way sometimes. Especially considering...~
@503  = ~An interesting perspective. Perhaps it is so.~
@504  = ~I am not pretending, <CHARNAME>, though only time will prove my words. And there is nothing easy about this, I assure you.~
@505  = ~Nothing has turned out the way I expected. All of my plans are worthless now, and it is odd that I feel grateful to you for that.~
@506  = ~That is a little odd. If I were you, I'd still have some resentment.~
@507  = ~It's not all that odd, and I'm glad to have helped.~
@508  = ~Grateful, huh? Exactly how grateful are we talking here?~
@509  = ~Time to make new plans then?~
@510  = ~Don't feel grateful. This is your doing, your choice, not mine.~
@511  = ~I never said I had *no* resentment.~
@512  = ~Grateful enough to remain loyal to you as long as you have need of me, even without the oath I offered you.~
@513  = ~Grateful enough to keep my oath and remain loyal to you for as long as you have need of me.~
@514  = ~The question now is what do I do with myself? I have never looked toward the future and had no plans. Not knowing one's path...it is a daunting thing.~
@515  = ~But come, I have wasted enough of your time.~
@516  = ~This wasn't a waste of time. Thank you for telling me.~
@517  = ~You'll hate to hear me say this, but I'm proud of you.~
@518  = ~Just to let you know, I'm open to being some part of that future. If you don't mind having me around, that is.~
@519  = ~You're right. Let's get moving.~
@520  = ~I believe it is I who should thank you.~
@521  = ~You're right. I do hate hearing you say that.~
@522  = ~But...thank you.~
@523  = ~I...we shall see.~
@524  = ~The end is nearing. Can you feel it? There is tension in the very air we breathe.~ [ls#blank]
@525  = ~Yes. It's like the world is holding its breath, waiting for me to do...something.~
@526  = ~I do feel it, and I fear it. I never wanted this life, Sarevok.~
@527  = ~I don't feel anything. Maybe a little hungry. My feet kinda hurt.~
@528  = ~Must you make everything so dramatic?~
@529  = ~The only thing I feel is impatient. I'm sick of all these obstacles.~
@530  = ~I am ready, Sarevok. Ready to finish this.~
@531  = ~You have always been a creature of destiny, <CHARNAME>. I denied it before, but I always knew you were different. I hated you for it, but now...~
@532  = ~You are strong, <CHARNAME>. You have nothing to fear.~
@533  = ~Must you make a joke of everything? I should be used to it by now.~
@534  = ~There must be some irony that you would say that to me.~
@535  = ~You are ready. Everything in your life has prepared you for this moment, no matter what lies ahead. And I...am grateful that you have allowed me to be part of it.~
@536  = ~It's strange how things have turned out, isn't it?~
@537  = ~I am grateful that you've stood by me.~
@538  = ~Well, you have this unique way of worming yourself into my life whether I want you there or not. I might as well take advantage of that, hmm?~
@539  = ~I'm still not sure letting you get involved in my life was the best thing...~
@540  = ~Indeed. Had someone told me a year or two ago that I would be standing here now, speaking these words to you, I would have laughed in his face. And then killed him for being a fool.~
@541  = ~Oddly enough, it has been an honor.~
@542  = ~(Sarevok chuckles, and for possibly the first time you can remember, his eyes shine with genuine amusement.) A wise decision.~
@543  = ~I understand your reluctance. In your shoes, I would likely feel much the same.~
@544  = ~I will ask no promises of you, <CHARNAME>. Someone once asked them of me, and I gave them too freely...and betrayed all of them. I do not wish to put you in that same position.~
@545  = ~But I must be honest...though it is difficult for me. I do not want to lose you. Not to death, or to anything else for that matter. It is my desire to be at your side, whatever the future holds.~
@546  = ~What do you think the future holds for us?~
@547  = ~I'm glad to hear you say that. I want you at my side too, Sarevok.~
@548  = ~Thank you for not asking promises of me. Who knows if we will even survive tomorrow?~
@549  = ~That feels a lot like a commitment you're seeking...but I'm glad you're not forcing any vows from me.~
@550  = ~We'll see.~
@551  = ~It pleases me to hear you say that.~
@552  = ~True enough.~
@553  = ~I honestly don't know. With the kind of attention the pair of us seem to attract, I cannot imagine it would be a quiet existence, at least not for long. But if I am with you, I think almost anything would be acceptable.~
@554  = ~What if I want to get married someday?~
@555  = ~What about children?~
@556  = ~What if I want to settle down and have a quiet life?~
@557  = ~I think I'd like to keep traveling and adventuring.~
@558  = ~I want to visit somewhere exotic. Like Calimshan, or Kara-Tur.~
@559  = ~I don't have a clue myself. I guess we can just make it up as we go along.~
@560  = ~(Sarevok pales.) I...I do not think this is the right time for such a discussion.~
@561  = ~Hah, I was only teasing you! By the gods, you looked terrified though!~
@562  = ~You're right. There will be plenty of time to discuss that after all this is over.~
@563  = ~If the look on your face is any indication, there will never be a 'right time.'~
@564  = ~Fine, have it your way.~
@565  = ~Most amusing...~
@566  = ~I...we should get moving.~
@567  = ~You know me too well.~
@568  = ~Thank you.~
@569  = ~Then I will find a way to adjust.~
@570  = ~That does not surprise me.~
@571  = ~Not Kara-Tur. Calimshan sounds tempting, though. It would be interesting to see you dressed in silks.~
@572  = ~Indeed we can.~
@573  = ~Come, <CHARNAME>. Your fight is not yet finished, and there will be plenty of time for talk when this is over.~
@574  = ~Do me a favor, Sarevok. Don't die. I'd hate to lose you now that I actually have a reason to keep you around.~
@575  = ~*If* we survive...~
@576  = ~You'll protect me...won't you?~
@577  = ~It's strange, but I'm not afraid of the future anymore.~
@578  = ~You're right. Let's get this over with.~
@579  = ~Hah! You echo my thoughts exactly, <CHARNAME>.~
@580  = ~Do not weaken yourself with doubts. We have been through much together and we can get through this as well.~
@581  = ~As I have from the day you brought me back from the dead.~
@582  = ~I...cannot honestly say I feel the same, but it is reassuring to hear you say so.~
@583  = ~(For the last several hours, Sarevok has been watching you more closely than usual and he is doing nothing to hide his attentions. Occasionally you catch him smiling after you, a cruel, dark twist of his lips, but he says nothing.)~
@584  = ~(He is confident, bordering on arrogant, and a few times you half expect him to laugh aloud. Something about his expression tells you that even if you asked, he wouldn't tell you what's on his mind. Still, his dark eyes follow you everywhere, drinking in the sight of your every move.)~
@585  = ~I am glad you were open to see reason, <CHARNAME>. You have the chance for so much power right at your fingertips! I have thought you a fool and a coward in the past, but now...~ [ls#blank]
@586  = ~Now...?~
@587  = ~I don't give a damn what you think of me, and I tire of your ceaseless interference. Just leave me be!~
@588  = ~I have seen you in battle, both as an enemy and as an ally, and I know you are no coward. And that is exactly why I know you have made the right choice. You know what is at stake, how powerful you can become!~
@589  = ~I do know, and I cannot wait to take hold of that power! I have been held back for so long...~
@590  = ~Well, I don't know for sure, but I can certainly imagine a whole mess of possibilities.~
@591  = ~Don't you feel at all jealous?~
@592  = ~I think you and I understand each other very well.~
@593  = ~You still don't understand - I want power, Sarevok, but not for the reasons you seem to think. I don't want to hurt anyone - I want to help.~
@594  = ~Yes, I understand your impatience well.~
@595  = ~Hah, I am certain you can.~
@596  = ~I...will not lie. A part of me will always be bitter that it is you, but there's no point dwelling upon that. You have offered me the chance to stand at your side, and that will satisfy me.~
@597  = ~So you say. Only time will show for certain.~
@598  = ~You have come far. It is hard to believe you are the same cowering child from Candlekeep, hiding behind Gorion's skirts.~
@599  = ~I am *not* that child. Not anymore.~
@600  = ~We all have to grow up eventually.~
@601  = ~I was *not* cowering!~
@602  = ~Do not speak of Gorion that way! He was a better man than you could ever hope to be!~
@603  = ~The very same ‘cowering child' who stood over your corpse as it dissolved to dust, as well.~
@604  = ~Are you trying to get a rise out of me?~
@605  = ~Clearly.~
@606  = ~Hah! Of that I have little doubt.~
@607  = ~Hah...well said.~
@608  = ~And why would I do that?~
@609  = ~I meant my words as praise. It's good that you have grown into the role fate seems to have prepared for you.~
@610  = ~Fate? I don't put much faith in fate.~
@611  = ~You believe in fate?~
@612  = ~Fate, destiny, prophecy...I tire of feeling as though my life has been planned for me.~
@613  = ~No one controls my future but me, Sarevok. My destiny is my own.~
@614  = ~Then thank you, I suppose.~
@615  = ~Whatever you say. Can we get going now?~
@616  = ~It seems nonsensical for anyone of our parentage to deny the workings of fate.~
@617  = ~I understand that resentment better than you possibly suspect.~
@618  = ~How can you be so certain? How can you prove that you are the one in control?~
@619  = ~Whether you believe it or not, fate has a hand in everything you do. Your entire life, from the moment you were conceived, has been one unlikely event after another - the workings of fate for certain.~
@620  = ~So you believe I have no choice in what I'm doing?~
@621  = ~I don't think you have a clue what you're talking about.~
@622  = ~You're boring me, Sarevok. Let's get moving.~
@623  = ~So, what if I just decide to do nothing then? What if I bury my head and pretend none of this is happening, or run, or...?~
@624  = ~Maybe you're right. My life has been pretty out of the ordinary.~
@625  = ~Heed my words, or ignore them - do what suits you, but I will speak my mind.~
@626  = ~I am not saying you cannot make your own path. You can choose what you do next. But there are some things you will never be able to escape, and your blood is one of them.~
@627  = ~That is why your ambition serves you well. You do not waste what you've been given by fighting against it. If you embrace what fate has given you, you will go far, <CHARNAME>, of that I am certain.~
@628  = ~Oh, I embrace it, and desire more. Let's hope that's what fate has waiting for me.~
@629  = ~I still think it sounds like I have no choice...and I don't like that.~
@630  = ~Sometimes I really hate being a Bhaalspawn.~
@631  = ~You know, the more we talk about this stuff, the more I doubt I really want all this power nonsense.~
@632  = ~Surely you jest. You would not be foolish enough to turn aside power, would you?~
@633  = ~No of course not, and I desire more than I've been given. Let's hope that's what fate has waiting for me.~
@634  = ~No, you just make it sound like I have no choice...and I don't like that.~
@635  = ~No, but sometimes I really hate being a Bhaalspawn.~
@636  = ~I'm serious, Sarevok. I think this is all just too much for me.~
@637  = ~I hope so as well, <CHARNAME>.~
@638  = ~I cannot blame you for that. It can be irritating to feel like the plaything of fate's games.~
@639  = ~I certainly hope you're joking, <CHARNAME>.~
@640  = ~Bah, why have I wasted my time? I have no desire to entertain the insecurities of the weak and unsure. We should get moving.~
@641  = ~No. None of my combat knowledge will serve you in battle. Stick to your magic.~
@642  = ~Then I'll just watch.~
@643  = ~Oh. Well, in that case, I'll just watch.~
@644  = ~I suppose I could teach you a thing or two. Very well. Prepare yourself.~
@645  = ~On second thought, I'd rather just watch you.~
@646  = ~(Sarevok smiles coldly in reply.) I am glad you enjoyed yourself.~
@647  = ~(Sarevok barks out a harsh laugh.) I am certain you are.~
@648  = ~Correct. Now...~
@649  = ~Excellent. Now quickly...~
@650  = ~(Sarevok shakes his head, but his dark eyes smolder and still don't stray from your face.) You surprise me, <CHARNAME>. Well done.~
@651  = ~(snort) Do not blame me if you hurt yourself. Next...~
@652  = ~(He stops and eyes you with a scowl.) You are strong, <CHARNAME>, but you have the dexterity of an overfed cow.~
@653  = ~If it is a wetnurse you desire, feel free to hire one in my stead. I did not realize you needed such hand-holding.~
@654  = ~(Sarevok sneers and turns away.)~
@655  = ~I am who I am.~
@656  = ~I do. Perhaps you should remind yourself how many times you turn your back to me in battle, and how many times I have saved your hide when I did not have to.~
@657  = ~Do not excuse your shortcomings. Strive to be more than you are - to do anything else is to fail.~
@658  = ~Enough, <CHARNAME>! There is nothing I can teach you. The gods only know how you have managed to survive thus far. Let us go.~
@659  = ~Have you any idea how fortunate you truly are?~ [ls#blank]
@660  = ~Of course I do.~
@661  = ~In what way?~
@662  = ~I don't always feel very fortunate, Sarevok.~
@663  = ~Fortunate? Hardly. I'm lucky if I survive day to day.~
@664  = ~What are you getting at?~
@665  = ~I'm really not in the mood for one of your lectures right now.~
@666  = ~In all ways, you fool!~
@667  = ~Luck?~
@668  = ~I wonder. You stumble around like a blind fool, surviving where others would have died, growing stronger from what would have torn anyone else to pieces! I doubt you have enough sense to be grateful that you are a creature of destiny.~
@669  = ~You are jealous of my success.~
@670  = ~I am no fool!~
@671  = ~Weren't we just talking about fate? If you believe the things you said, it shouldn't surprise you that I have been successful.~
@672  = ~Sometimes I wished I hadn't survived, Sarevok! The things I have been through, the things I have seen…no one should have to continue to live with those memories!~
@673  = ~I *am* grateful, and that is why I intend to make the best of what I've been given.~
@674  = ~I have had enough of this from you! Leave me alone!~
@675  = ~You think so?~
@676  = ~Then prove it!~
@677  = ~Do not use my own words against me when you have so obviously not learned their meaning!~
@678  = ~Then that makes things all the worse! You continue to succeed even when you do not wish to!~
@679  = ~I have had my chance and failed, but I cannot stop myself from thinking that in your place now *I* would do so much more! Fate is wasted on one such as you!~
@680  = ~Your bitterness and jealousy serve no one, Sarevok. Stop wasting your anger on me and focus on our enemies!~
@681  = ~More? What more could I possibly do?!~
@682  = ~I'm doing everything I can.~
@683  = ~Where in the Nine Hells is this coming from?~
@684  = ~I didn't ask for this life, Sarevok!~
@685  = ~How long do you think I will tolerate this kind of behavior from you?~
@686  = ~Hah! You assume that all our enemies are the same. Enough of this!~
@687  = ~There is always more that can be done! You can never give too much to attain what you truly desire!~
@688  = ~And yet it is what you have been given! Will you spurn your gifts so recklessly?!~
@689  = ~Gods, why must it be you? Of all the Bhaalspawn, why have *you* risen above the rest?~
@690  = ~Because I'm stronger, Sarevok - stronger even than you.~
@691  = ~As you said before, fate chose me.~
@692  = ~Why do I get the feeling that there is no correct answer to this question...?~
@693  = ~Honestly, I have no idea.~
@694  = ~I haven't risen above anything yet - you assume that my luck will continue!~
@695  = ~Strength will not be the only thing you need to succeed, you fool!~
@696  = ~Yes, fate chose you, but *why*, fool?!~
@697  = ~I am a fool to try to help you. Your ambition will falter, your strength will wear thin, and you will crumble like the weakling you surely are!~
@698  = ~If you really feel this way, then why in the hells *are* you helping me?~
@699  = ~I will not rise to your attempt to goad me, Sarevok. Give it a rest.~
@700  = ~Hah! I shall prove you wrong.~
@701  = ~If you wish me to gut you right here, right now, then by all means, continue your taunts.~
@702  = ~In everything I have been through, I have not wavered. I will not waver now.~
@703  = ~So be it.~
@704  = ~I have no idea.~
@705  = ~Because I will not break my oath.~
@706  = ~I would be glad if you tried it - then at least I would truly know your conviction!~
@707  = ~So you say.~
@708  = ~What you stand to gain if all goes as I believe it will is beyond the imaginings of mortal men! It is wasted on you, you who cannot even truly comprehend what you could control!~
@709  = ~I know exactly what I'm doing, Sarevok, and I will not let any opportunity pass me by. I can assure you of that.~
@710  = ~I've heard just about enough of this from you!~
@711  = ~Enough with the lecture already. I have better things to do.~
@712  = ~And what if I do waste it, hmm? It will be *mine* to waste! Your chance is over and done with Sarevok - let it go already.~
@713  = ~We shall see.~
@714  = ~You truly are a fool if you would throw your chance away simply to spite me!~
@715  = ~Unless you are truly prepared for what lies ahead, then you would be better off burying your head in the sand or running back to your precious Candlekeep! Bah! Enough of this!~
@716  = ~(Sarevok has been cold and distant since the last time you spoke, so it is surprising when he moves up beside you. Frowning, he eyes your pack critically.) Stop a moment, <CHARNAME>.~
@717  = ~What are you going to gripe about now?~
@718  = ~I think you just wanted an excuse to touch me.~
@719  = ~(snort) Save your thanks.~
@720  = ~You truly think I need an excuse?~
@721  = ~You should learn how to pack and carry the weight properly so that it does not impair you in battle. I am surprised you have no yet gotten yourself killed.~
@722  = ~(Sarevok moves away without giving you a chance to reply. As you continue on your way, the now comfortable pressure of the pack against your back, and the way his eyes move your direction frequently, leave you to wonder on his true motivations.)~
@723  = ~<CHARNAME>, I...perhaps I should not have been so...blunt with my earlier words to you...~ [ls#blank]
@724  = ~Ya think?~
@725  = ~Is this your idea of an apology?~
@726  = ~(Wait for him to continue.)~
@727  = ~I don't know why I put up with you half the time.~
@728  = ~Why am I letting you help me?~
@729  = ~It's okay - most of what you said was right.~
@730  = ~I don't give a damn. I've had enough of your 'help.' Just get away from me!~
@731  = ~No, because I am not apologizing.~
@732  = ~Only you know the answer to that.~
@733  = ~I am...glad to hear you say that, even if it surprises me.~
@734  = ~I...as you wish.~
@735  = ~I meant everything I said, <CHARNAME>. I apologize for nothing that was said, but the way I said it could have been better.~
@736  = ~*Could* have been?~
@737  = ~So you really think I'm a ‘blind fool,' that fate is wasted on me, that you could do better?!~
@738  = ~Why did you lash out at me?~
@739  = ~I have often relied on your advice, but it's hard to do that when you're screaming in my face.~
@740  = ~As I said...I meant my words.~
@741  = ~I know.~
@742  = ~I was foolish enough to allow my emotions to taint the point I was trying to make. It will not happen again.~
@743  = ~Good.~
@744  = ~I hope not, or next time I might forget to stop the Slayer from ripping your head from your shoulders.~
@745  = ~And the point you were trying to make was...?~
@746  = ~Emotions? You mean your jealousy that this is happening to me and not you?~
@747  = ~Emotions...? Are you saying you have feelings for me?~
@748  = ~I don't give a damn. I've had enough of your ‘help.' Just get away from me!~
@749  = ~Point taken.~
@750  = ~I...I suppose you could put it that way...~
@751  = ~I...no.~
@752  = ~You have come far, <CHARNAME>, and not all of that has been because of some preordained destiny. Even without the workings of fate, I can see that you would have accomplished much on your own.~
@753  = ~That sounds like the exact *opposite* of what you said last time.~
@754  = ~Why couldn't you have just said that?~
@755  = ~I already know that.~
@756  = ~I still don't believe in all this destiny nonsense.~
@757  = ~Go on...~
@758  = ~Allow me to explain.~
@759  = ~I have no doubt that by the time all of this plays out, you will have no choice but to believe in destiny.~
@760  = ~You cannot allow anything to hold you back. Your enemies are not the only hindrance you have, and you cannot allow *any* obstacle to make you falter – especially not your own doubt.~
@761  = ~You're wrong - my enemies *are* my only obstacle.~
@762  = ~Doubt? I have no doubts, Sarevok.~
@763  = ~You're speaking from personal experience...aren't you?~
@764  = ~Get to the point.~
@765  = ~Enough talk. Let's get moving.~
@766  = ~Do not make the mistake of believing that! Do not be blind to your own weaknesses.~
@767  = ~Very well...~
@768  = ~Someone once made me feel tied down to this world, chained by emotion or some notion of loyalty...you must not make that mistake yourself! The price of failure will be your life, and the reward of success could be immortality!~
@769  = ~Trust me when I say that I know what I desire, and it will be mine, this world be damned!~
@770  = ~I understand, Sarevok.~
@771  = ~Let me guess - this ‘someone' was Tamoko.~
@772  = ~We'll see...~
@773  = ~Good. Hold tight to that conviction, <CHARNAME>.~
@774  = ~I hope you do.~
@775  = ~Your answer doesn't exactly inspire confidence, <CHARNAME>...~
@776  = ~I...that does not matter now.~
@777  = ~You deserve more than you have on this world. There is nothing here for you that is not worth sacrificing to gain unlimited power. Remember that.~
@778  = ~Yes. It's like the world is holding its breath, waiting for me to take my rightful place amongst the gods.~
@779  = ~I do feel it and...in some way, I fear it. I never asked for this life, Sarevok...~
@780  = ~I don't feel anything. Maybe a little hungry...my feet kinda hurt...~
@781  = ~I believe so as well.~
@782  = ~Silence your doubts, <CHARNAME>! If you cannot overcome these fears, I know not what will become of you.~
@783  = ~Enough of your foolishness.~
@784  = ~Yes, this is a feeling I know all too well.~
@785  = ~There is a...debt that I feel I owe you. Bah, I never imagined I would be speaking these words to you!~
@786  = ~Hah, how does humility taste, Sarevok?~
@787  = ~A debt? Why?~
@788  = ~I can imagine that was difficult for you to say. Take your time.~
@789  = ~You don't owe me anything.~
@790  = ~You're damned right you owe me!~
@791  = ~Bitter.~
@792  = ~But I do.~
@793  = ~I have given you my oath, and so my words may not mean much, but...even had I not made that vow, I would still feel...grateful to you, both for bringing me back from the dead, and for allowing me the honor of standing at your side.~
@794  = ~The honor is mine, Sarevok. We make a good team.~
@795  = ~You have served me well.~
@796  = ~Going soft on me, Sarevok?~
@797  = ~Don't waste your gratitude on me. What I need is your allegiance, and that I have through your oath.~
@798  = ~I'm already bored with this conversation.~
@799  = ~I have give you no oath, and you have asked for none, and so I hope you understand the significance of what I say. I am...grateful to you, both for bringing me back from the dead, and for allowing me the honor of standing at your side.~
@800  = ~Don't waste your gratitude on me. What I need is your allegiance.~
@801  = ~Yes, we do. A pity I did not know that sooner.~
@802  = ~And I shall continue to do so, if you will have me.~
@803  = ~Hah, do you think so? I merely wish to be clear about my fealty to you.~
@804  = ~Hear me out.~
@805  = ~I now strongly believe that you will have the opportunity that I was denied. Whether through these events unfolding before us now, or by some other means, I believe that your destiny is to take your place with the gods.~
@806  = ~When that day comes, I have only one request: remember me.~
@807  = ~What kind of request is that?~
@808  = ~Already begging favors of your goddess?~
@809  = ~I make no promises.~
@810  = ~Feh, you are useful to me here and now, but when I ascend, what makes you think I will spare one thought to you?~
@811  = ~A favor I believe I can return in equal measure.~
@812  = ~All gods have need of mortals, whether to serve as their eyes and ears, to gather followers to their banners, or...to lead their armies. That is my offer to you.~
@813  = ~Allow me to be your general here in this world. Give me command of your armies and the lands shall burn to glorify your name! All men will tremble with fear at the mention of your divine wrath!~
@814  = ~I like the sound of that.~
@815  = ~Only if you call me 'my goddess.'~
@816  = ~It would be my honor to accept you as my general.~
@817  = ~How do I know I can trust you?~
@818  = ~I don't want the lands to burn, Sarevok! Why does power always equal tyranny to you?~
@819  = ~I have no interest in your schemes.~
@820  = ~Okay, I'm done with this conversation.~
@821  = ~Of course you do.~
@822  = ~You are not one yet, but...as you command, my goddess.~
@823  = ~Hah! Say it again.~
@824  = ~Very nice. Still...how do I know I can trust you?~
@825  = ~Forget it. I have no interest in your schemes.~
@826  = ~(sigh) I am at your service, my...goddess.~
@827  = ~It was fun watching you do that, but I'm done with this conversation.~
@828  = ~Betray a god? Hah, even my ambition has boundaries, <CHARNAME>. No, I would not betray you.~
@829  = ~But I don't want the lands to burn, Sarevok! Why does power always equal tyranny to you?~
@830  = ~Because they are one and the same, <CHARNAME>, whether you are willing to see it or not.~
@831  = ~Why do you avoid answering me? Have I not earned an answer?~
@832  = ~Very well. It would be my honor to accept you as my general.~
@833  = ~Fine, you can be my general if I become a god.~
@834  = ~I knew you would see reason! You will not regret this, <CHARNAME>. I will serve you till the end of my days, and beyond if need be.~
@835  = ~But come. There is still work to be done before you can take your rightful place...my goddess.~
@836  = ~A lot of pressure has been placed on you lately. I understand your reluctance...still, I am yours, <CHARNAME>, your servant should you have need of me when the time comes.~
@837  = ~We should keep moving. There is still work to be done before you can take your rightful place.~
@838  = ~(Sarevok told you to seek him out when next you rested.)~ [ls#blank]
@839  = ~(Go to him.)~
@840  = ~(Go to bed.)~
@841  = ~You surprise me, <CHARNAME>. I did not think you this brazen.~
@842  = ~You surprise me as well. I did not think you this willing.~
@843  = ~I'm full of surprises.~
@844  = ~I don't think words are necessary right now.~
@845  = ~I-I don't think I want to do this...~
@846  = ~I'm not here for that. Get some rest.~
@847  = ~I admit, there is something...intriguing about the notion of intimacy with one who has taken my life before. Something unpredictable. Will you attempt it again? Will I take revenge while you are defenseless...?~
@848  = ~I am never defenseless.~
@849  = ~I find the idea thrilling as well.~
@850  = ~I'm not interested in this right now. Get some rest, Sarevok.~
@851  = ~Ah, yes, with the Slayer that is true. But...perhaps I can find ways to strip away those defenses...~
@852  = ~Hah, suddenly shy, are you?~
@853  = ~So what are you waiting for, <CHARNAME>? Or are you going to run back to your bed like a frightened maid?~
@854  = ~Do you really want to do this?~
@855  = ~I'm not running anywhere, but...I *am* a maid.~
@856  = ~No, I'm not. (Kiss him.)~
@857  = ~Maybe some other time. I'm going to sleep.~
@858  = ~I'm not interested in this from you. Get some rest, Sarevok.~
@859  = ~Hah, I can only hope you realize that giving yourself to me will mean nothing. I am not here to coddle your fears, <CHARNAME>. Be mindful of what you're getting yourself into.~
@860  = ~I understand, but...do you really want to do this?~
@861  = ~Oh, I know exactly what I'm getting myself into. (Kiss him.)~
@862  = ~Forget it. I'm going to sleep.~
@863  = ~Odd. You gave me the impression that my wants were irrelevant.~
@864  = ~I didn't mean to come across that way. Please tell me. Do you really want me?~
@865  = ~They *are* irrelevant. But I'm curious. Do you really want me?~
@866  = ~You're right. They are irrelevant. (Kiss him.)~
@867  = ~You're right. They are irrelevant, so shut up and kiss me.~
@868  = ~Never mind, Sarevok. I'm going to bed.~
@869  = ~What I want is power, and that is something you have. If this is what I must do to gain your favor, then...I will not complain.~
@870  = ~And you expect me to be satisfied with that answer?~
@871  = ~Good enough for me. (Kiss him.)~
@872  = ~Very well. Kiss me.~
@873  = ~All you want is power? Never mind, Sarevok. I'm going to bed.~
@874  = ~Did you expect me to coddle your ego?~
@875  = ~Ultimately, I desire the power you control. But...if this is what you wish of me, I am not foolish enough to deny the wants of a powerful, attractive woman.~
@876  = ~Powerful and attractive, hmm? I like the sound of that.~
@877  = ~You know very well that you are a powerful, attractive woman. Any number of men would fall at your feet, begging for your favor. I take your attentions as a compliment, and I am not foolish enough to deny your wants. Or my own.~
@878  = ~You desire me.~
@879  = ~Only a blind man would not.~

@890  = ~(Slip out of his grasp and sneak away.)~
@891  = ~(It isn't long before the man stirs, his arm tightening briefly around you before his groggy voice rumbles in your ear.)~
@892  = ~(The moment you move, Sarevok's arm tightens around you waist, holding you in place.)~
@893  = ~You did not slip out while I was sleeping as I expected.~
@894  = ~Why would I do that?~
@895  = ~I overslept. Now let me go.~
@896  = ~Does that happen to you often?~
@897  = ~Neither did you.~
@898  = ~There are any number of reasons. Guilt, shame...perhaps you came to your senses and realized you had just given yourself to the murderer of your foster father...~
@899  = ~(sigh) Must you sabotage a perfectly enjoyable experience with your usual snide remarks?~
@900  = ~If you must know, I do feel guilty.~
@901  = ~For your information, I don't feel guilty at all.~
@902  = ~Yes, I feel so guilty that I think we should do this on a regular basis.~
@903  = ~And why should I do that? I seem to have you in a very vulnerable position...and I must admit I am enjoying it.~
@904  = ~Twice. They were both married and knew I would paint the walls with their husbands' blood should we be interrupted.~
@905  = ~Clearly you do not recall who is currently in whose bed.~
@906  = ~I was certain your guilt would have caught up with you by now. How does it feel to have given yourself so freely to your dear foster father's murderer?~
@907  = ~Of course.~
@908  = ~As I expected. And yet you are still here, in my bed.~
@909  = ~Of course I am. I've never let a little guilt stop me from getting what I want.~
@910  = ~Because you won't let me go.~
@911  = ~Just because I *do* feel guilty doesn't mean I *should* feel guilty. And besides, I feel more satisfied than guilty...~
@912  = ~Not for long.~
@913  = ~I see. Perhaps I have misjudged you.~
@914  = ~As usual. Now stop hogging the blankets and don't wake me for at least eight hours.~
@915  = ~I misjudged you as well. I did not think you could keep up with me last night, but you proved your worth.~
@916  = ~Let me go now.~
@917  = ~Wonderful. Let's get moving, shall we?~
@918  = ~Am I to then assume that this is not a one time occurance, <CHARNAME>?~
@919  = ~You assume correctly. I expect compliance whenever I have need of you.~
@920  = ~I believe it would be in both our best interests if we shared a bed whenever possible.~
@921  = ~I'm not sure.~
@922  = ~I think it would be better if we just forgot this ever happened.~
@923  = ~This was great and all, but it won't happen again.~
@924  = ~This was a mistake.~
@925  = ~I assume that this was a one time event, then.~
@926  = ~You assume correctly. I have no intention of repeating this mistake.~
@927  = ~Wrong. I believe it would be in both our best interests if we shared a bed whenever possible.~
@928  = ~You should never assume. I expect compliance whenever I have need of you, Sarevok.~
@929  = ~Hah! We shall see, <CHARNAME>...we shall see.~
@930  = ~Do you? I am certain there are valid reasons that we should not, but for some reason, I am unable to come up with any at this moment...~
@931  = ~You seemed sure last night.~
@932  = ~Last night was a mistake, one I have no intention of repeating.~
@933  = ~I was sure last night, but right now I think it would be best if we just forgot this ever happened.~
@934  = ~(sigh) As I said, I'm just not sure.~
@935  = ~Mmm, yes...last night was...you know, I think it would be in both of our best interests if we share a bed as often as possible.~
@936  = ~Very well then, Sarevok. I expect full compliance whenever I have need of you.~
@937  = ~Hah, very well.~
@938  = ~(As you are preparing to rest, Sarevok takes you by the arm and draws you aside. Something about his expression seems almost nervous.)~ [ls#blank]

@949  = ~Unless that's a dagger hidden in your pants, you obviously want me as well.~
@950  = ~I do, but not like this.~
@951  = ~A lady never tells.~
@952  = ~What? No! You are useful to me, Sarevok. That is all.~
@953  = ~Even if I do, I don't trust you enough to be so...exposed with you.~
@954  = ~(Sarevok eases back after a moment, but does not release his hold on you as he scrutinizes your face.)~
@955  = ~Tell me I have not misread you. I know you desire me.~
@956  = ~(Sarevok breaks off the kiss, but does not release his hold on you as he scrutinizes your face.)~
@957  = ~I cannot have misread you. I know you want this.~
@958  = ~Don't play coy with me.~
@959  = ~I see. Then I apologize for my assumption. Rest well...<CHARNAME>.~
@960  = ~And yet you trust me at your back with a weapon.~
@961  = ~I admit it. I want you~
@962  = ~I want you, Sarevok, but not like this.~
@963  = ~Forget it. You are useful to me, Sarevok. That is all.~
@964  = ~There is something I must make clear before this...progresses. This cannot mean anything.~
@965  = ~I desire you, you desire me, and so there is no reason to deny ourselves this. *Unless* it holds you back.~
@966  = ~Oh, I see. You're afraid I'll get emotionally attached to you.~
@967  = ~Are you afraid that I'll fall in love with you or something? Hah! No, Sarevok...just, no.~
@968  = ~You believe that me caring about you will somehow hold me back?~
@969  = ~If you're afraid that I'm going to develop feelings for you, then I'm sorry but it's too late to stop that from happening.~
@970  = ~You're really over-thinking this. Just shut up and take me before I change my mind.~
@971  = ~Oh, forget it. I didn't really want you that bad anyway.~
@972  = ~What do you mean by that?~
@973  = ~Aren't you afraid I'll get emotionally attached to you?~
@974  = ~I don't know. It's not like I'm going to fall in love with you or anything.~
@975  = ~I have feelings for you, Sarevok.~
@976  = ~I'm relieved to hear you say so.~
@977  = ~Hah! I would be a fool to deny you...~
@978  = ~What? No! You cannot allow yourself to be tied down, <CHARNAME>!~
@979  = ~I'm sorry...I can't help it.~
@980  = ~I don't care, Sarevok. I don't want to change my feelings for you.~
@981  = ~Tied down? I care about you, Sarevok, but not enough to deny myself the power I truly crave.~
@982  = ~Hah, don't worry. Nothing will stand in my way of attaining power. Certainly not you.~
@983  = ~No! I will not allow you to lose your chance, not when you are so close! I was a fool to get this close to you...~
@984  = ~I have wanted you for far too long. Stay with me, <CHARNAME>.~
@985  = ~All you had to do was ask.~
@986  = ~If that's what you want.~
@987  = ~Forget it. I didn't really want you that bad anyway.~
@988  = ~It is.~
@989  = ~(Sarevok's mouth is hot and passionate against your own. His hands tug impatiently at your clothing and coherent thought is lost in a blur of sensations - his rough palms exploring your curves, his dark eyes following your every movement, his scarred skin pressed to yours.)~
@990  = ~(He will be gone by the time you wake, and there is little doubt that he will never mention this moment again. His voice whispers in your ear, murmuring your name, and then there is nothing else in the world but his embrace. At least for the next few hours.)~
@991  = ~(You are about to retire to your bed when you notice Sarevok sitting alone, flipping slowly through the pages of a leather-bound book. There is an odd, almost amused expression on his face.)~ [ls#blank]
@992  = ~(Go sit with him.)~
@993  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>...what a fool I have been.~
@994  = ~Well, I could have told you that.~
@995  = ~What makes you say that?~
@996  = ~Have you been drinking?~
@997  = ~What are you reading?~
@998  = ~Shouldn't you be resting?~
@999  = ~Of that I am certain.~
@1000 = ~A bit. Not nearly enough.~
@1001 = ~Soon.~
@1002 = ~This is my...journal, I suppose. I have kept notes on my plans since you brought me back from the dead.~
@1003 = ~Oh, you must let me read it!~
@1004 = ~What does it say?~
@1005 = ~Why are you reading it now?~
@1006 = ~Odd - I never pegged you as the kind of guy to keep a diary.~
@1007 = ~No. Believe me when I say nothing good can come from you reading this.~
@1008 = ~Oh, come on! Please?~
@1009 = ~Don't be such a baby. Just one passage.~
@1010 = ~(sigh) Fine...~
@1011 = ~(sigh) Very well...but you have been warned.~
@1012 = ~(He frowns at the book for a few seconds, then opens to an entry near the back and thrusts the journal toward you.)~
@1013 = ~(Take the book and read the entry.)~
@1014 = ~(Take the book and flip back to the first entry.)~
@1015 = ~(Push the book back to him.) No, never mind. You're probably right that it won't do any good to read it.~
@1016 = ~'I live again! Just when I was beginning to believe that I would never get back to this world, the fool fell right into my lap! She has even taken me along with her - she may as well have slit her own throat. My vengeance shall be fulfilled! Although...'~
@1017 = ~'There may be other uses for her. There is power in her wake, as much as I am loathe to admit it...I shall be patient and see. Perhaps this will work out better than I'd ever imagined.'~
@1018 = ~(Flip to an entry near the middle.)~
@1019 = ~(Flip to the last entry.)~
@1020 = ~(Hand the book back to Sarevok.) You're right. That didn't do any good.~
@1021 = ~(Hurl the book at Sarevok.) You bastard! And to think I trusted you!~
@1022 = ~'She is mad! She *must* be mad! No one in their right mind would pass up the opportunities she is sure to have! I was a fool to waste my time on her. All of my words fall on deaf ears. I should have killed her when I had the chance...'~
@1023 = ~I told you it would do no good.~
@1024 = ~'I cannot stand this. What's wrong with me? I don't even know myself anymore. She has...changed me. No! I am still myself! And yet...I cannot deny the things she tells me. I cannot delude myself into thinking she is a fool. Not anymore. But if she has not been the fool...then I have...'~
@1025 = ~(Close the book and say nothing.)~
@1026 = ~Very interesting.~
@1027 = ~Here, take your journal back. I'm going to bed, Sarevok.~
@1028 = ~As expected.~
@1029 = ~(Sarevok gently extracts the book from your grasp.)~
@1030 = ~Nothing of value.~
@1031 = ~Hmph. It is a *journal* and you keep one as well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1032 = ~I intend to burn this worthless thing in the morning. I suppose curiosity led me to peruse its pages one last time.~
@1033 = ~(Snatch the book from him and fling it into the fire.)~
@1034 = ~There's a perfectly serviceable fire right over there. Why wait until morning?~
@1035 = ~Curiosity? Are you having second thoughts about changing your life around?~
@1036 = ~That's great, Sarevok. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need my beauty sleep.~
@1037 = ~(Sarevok stiffens in surprise, but his face becomes calm as he watches the flames curl around the book, destroying and consuming the words fueled by his embittered past. After a moment, he turns to you with an unreadable look.)~
@1038 = ~Sorry. I just thought you needed a push in the right direction.~
@1039 = ~What?~
@1040 = ~(Hold his gaze and say nothing.)~
@1041 = ~I...~
@1042 = ~You are correct. (Though he is frowning, Sarevok doesn't hesitate as he lifts the book and tosses it into the fire. For a moment he watches the flames destroy and consume the words fueled by his embittered past, then turns to you with an unreadable look.)~
@1043 = ~Well done.~
@1044 = ~No. But I would be a fool to forget who I once was.~
@1045 = ~Rest well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1046 = ~You're welcome.~
@1047 = ~(Smile and touch his cheek.) You are most welcome.~
@1048 = ~Think nothing of it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need my beauty sleep.~
@1049 = ~(Sarevok nods stiffly and stands.) If you will excuse me...~
@1050 = ~(Sarevok's muscles twitch under your fingertips, but his eyes burn into yours with a dark intensity.) <CHARNAME>...~
@1051 = ~(Pull your hand away.) Goodnight, Sarevok.~
@1052 = ~Sarevok, tell me what you want.~
@1053 = ~I care about you, Sarevok, but...I'm not ready for this.~
@1054 = ~If you want me, Sarevok, take me. You may have changed, but some things about you never will.~
@1055 = ~(Sarevok's mouth is warm and willing, and there is a deep longing in his touch as his rough hands caress your jaw and delve into your hair. His strained whisper reaches your ears in between heated kisses.)~
@1056 = ~<CHARNAME>...if this is not what you want...stop now. I don't think...~
@1057 = ~(Silence him with a firm kiss.)~
@1058 = ~This is what I want. I want you.~
@1059 = ~I...I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have...~
@1060 = ~This was a mistake, Sarevok. Forgive me.~
@1061 = ~I...this is not what I am accustomed to...~
@1062 = ~You mean something that might be more than lust?~
@1063 = ~Sorry, Sarevok, but I'm just not buying the whole ‘innocent virgin' act.~
@1064 = ~(Pull your hand away.) I'm sorry, Sarevok. I should never have implied that I wanted something more from you.~
@1065 = ~Yes.~
@1066 = ~(sigh) That is not what I meant.~
@1067 = ~(Sarevok takes a long, slow breath, as if steeling his resolve, then leans in to place a soft, restrained kiss on your lips.)~
@1068 = ~(Return the kiss.)~
@1069 = ~(Pull away.) I care about you, Sarevok, but...I'm not ready for this.~
@1070 = ~(Pull away.) I'm sorry. I was wrong to imply I wanted this from you.~
@1071 = ~(It's unclear how the two of you manage to separate long enough to get to a bed, or even whose bed you end up in, but if the passion in Sarevok's dark eyes is any indication, you should expect to get little sleep this night.)~
@1072 = ~So it was not a dream.~
@1073 = ~Do you wish it was?~
@1074 = ~Have you dreamed of me like this before, then?~
@1075 = ~No, it was not.~
@1076 = ~(Groan and roll over to bury your face in his chest.) Sleeping still...~
@1077 = ~But I wish it had been. This was a mistake, Sarevok.~
@1078 = ~(sigh) Why do women ask such questions?~
@1079 = ~It would be best if I refuse to answer that.~
@1080 = ~(Sarevok chuckles low and rumbling in his chest, his fingers threading idly through your hair for a moment.)~
@1081 = ~You...are serious? I...I see. Then I am a fool. Very well. I will bother you no longer.~
@1082 = ~Are you...happy?~
@1083 = ~Yes, I am.~
@1084 = ~How could I not be? I've been dying to get that armor off of you for the longest time!~
@1085 = ~I don't know, Sarevok. It's been so long since I've felt anything but pain that it may take time for me to work out what I'm feeling.~
@1086 = ~Are you?~
@1087 = ~No, Sarevok. I...this was a huge mistake.~
@1088 = ~(Sarevok frowns and avoids your eyes for a moment, but he doesn't seem actually displeased with your answer.)~
@1089 = ~(Sarevok chuckles and slides his hand up the curve of your hip to pull you closer.) I would be lying if I said I was disappointed that you have finally succeeded.~
@1090 = ~Yes, this I understand. I feel much the same.~
@1091 = ~I am new to this, <CHARNAME>. I am still trying to sort out who I am, who I want to be, *where* I want to be for that matter, but I am certain that I do not want to lose this...lose you.~
@1092 = ~(Kiss him.) Then don't lose me.~
@1093 = ~I'm glad to hear you say that.~
@1094 = ~Then let us try to figure ourselves out together.~
@1095 = ~I...I'm sorry, Sarevok, but I think this was a mistake.~
@1096 = ~(Sarevok sighs and tightens his arms around you, his whole body seeming to relax as if some great burden has lifted from his shoulders.)~
@1097 = ~Come, <CHARNAME>, we have delayed long enough, and your destiny still awaits you.~
@1098 = ~(Kiss him.) Okay, let's get moving.~
@1099 = ~Oh, I don't think so. Did you really think I was finished with you already?~
@1100 = ~(Sarevok murmurs a laugh against the crux of your shoulder. His rough stubble rasps against your skin, but his lips are soft and warm as they explore the slope of your neck.)~
@1101 = ~Is this your revenge, then? You intend to kill me through exhaustion?~
@1102 = ~Kill you? Absolutely not. I cannot imagine who would warm my bed then...~
@1103 = ~Maybe...but there are worse ways to die.~
@1104 = ~Absolutely. Let's see how long it takes, shall we?~
@1105 = ~I have no desire to imagine, and should any man attempt it while I yet live, I will split him from groin to throat.~
@1106 = ~Mmm...we are in full agreement on that.~
@1107 = ~As you command.~
@1108 = ~The Imprisoned One.~
@1109 = ~Rather ominous title.~
@1110 = ~Why do I have a bad feeling about this?~
@1111 = ~I'm waiting for you to start complaining about a pointless delay...~
@1112 = ~Sounds like a real charmer, huh? I can't wait to meet him.~
@1113 = ~You think I shouldn't have accepted the job.~
@1114 = ~Look, the sooner we get in there and finish this, the sooner we can leave. So, let's go.~
@1115 = ~Because you are not as stupid as you sometimes seem to be.~
@1116 = ~Do you take nothing seriously?~
@1117 = ~I must admit, <CHARNAME>, I am curious about this creature.~
@1118 = ~Because it's depraved and evil?~
@1119 = ~Because it's been imprisoned for so long?~
@1120 = ~That's really creepy, Sarevok.~
@1121 = ~I just want to get this over with and get out of here.~
@1122 = ~So am I.~
@1123 = ~That's great. Can we get going now?~
@1124 = ~Not every evil is worthy of curiosity.~
@1125 = ~Truly?~
@1126 = ~Trapped, caged for so long. Denied freedom, or even the right to die. It is a level of depravity beyond anything I ever conjured up, and yet these Watchers are called 'just.'~
@1127 = ~Are you insinuating that the things you did are somehow less evil than this Imprisoned One's punishment?~
@1128 = ~You don't even know the crimes of this creature - how can you say whether the punishment is just or not?~
@1129 = ~When you put it that way, it doesn't seem right.~
@1130 = ~I agree completely. These Watchers don't even seem to know why this beast must be kept caged!~
@1131 = ~It's not my place to interfere with their duty, even if I disagree with it.~
@1132 = ~Yeah...can we just get going now?~
@1133 = ~Enough of this pointless drivel! Get moving!~
@1134 = ~Evil comes in many forms, <CHARNAME>.~
@1135 = ~I cannot. I judge solely based on what I know right now.~
@1136 = ~And yet you interfere by doing their duty for them. Fickle woman.~
@1137 = ~Hah, are you frightened, little girl?~
@1138 = ~No.~
@1139 = ~No, but if you are, I can have the Slayer hold your hand while we explore this place.~
@1140 = ~Just shut up and get moving.~
@1141 = ~Do no let that fear control you, fool, or you shall get us killed.~
@1142 = ~Hah! Clever girl.~
@1143 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, why are you really helping these Watchers?~
@1144 = ~It's the right thing to do, Sarevok.~
@1145 = ~It is my duty to aid those I am able to.~
@1146 = ~I don't know. Boredom?~
@1147 = ~Are you kidding? How much treasure there must be in this place!~
@1148 = ~As you said, this Imprisoned One sounds fascinating. I want to meet him.~
@1149 = ~I'm going to betray those Helmite fools and allow the creature trapped here to feast on their blood, obviously.~
@1150 = ~I'll keep my reasons to myself.~
@1151 = ~I'm tired of this conversation.~
@1152 = ~A matter of perspective perhaps...~
@1153 = ~Bah, duty. These Helmites pass *their* duty on to you and you so willingly bear it. Fool.~
@1154 = ~You would be wise to spend your energy pursuing your birthright instead.~
@1155 = ~A lot of good that gold will do you if you are killed in this prison.~
@1156 = ~Very well. You truly are Bhaal's daughter.~
@1157 = ~Do you intend to free this demon?~
@1158 = ~Of course not! We'll find another way to open that portal.~
@1159 = ~I don't know yet.~
@1160 = ~I don't see how I have any other choice.~
@1161 = ~Why wouldn't I?~
@1162 = ~Why do you want to know?~
@1163 = ~Don't question my decisions!~
@1164 = ~And if there is no other way?~
@1165 = ~I wouldn't dream of it.~
@1166 = ~Surely you must realize that this creature will betray you the moment you set it free.~
@1167 = ~Fascinating that you would say such a thing. By bringing you back to life, I essentially set you free, Sarevok. Are *you* going to betray me?~
@1168 = ~But...it said we were helping each other! Why would it turn against us?~
@1169 = ~Maybe, maybe not, but we don't have another option right now.~
@1170 = ~Good. Then I won't have to make up an excuse to bleed the bastard dry.~
@1171 = ~Thanks for the sage advice, oh wise one. Can we get going now, or would you like to explain to me how babies are made too?~
@1172 = ~We shall just have to wait and see, won't we?~
@1173 = ~Gods...how have you survived this long?~
@1174 = ~Hah! True enough, though I never needed an excuse.~
@1175 = ~Is that a proposition, my dear sister?~
@1176 = ~The Blood War. A part of me always found it fascinating, but now that I see it first hand, I realize it is nothing but a pointless waste.~
@1177 = ~Yes, all those lives lost for nothing, and so many innocents caught in the middle.~
@1178 = ~It does seem like a lot of effort with no gain to speak of.~
@1179 = ~I have to disagree. Death, destruction and war are never a waste.~
@1180 = ~Why do you say that?~
@1181 = ~You're under the mistaken impression that I give a damn about your opinions.~
@1182 = ~What? Hah, you truly believe *that* is my concern?~
@1183 = ~These baatezu and tanar'ri, they fight without end, and have fought since time immemorial. But what have they gained?~
@1184 = ~Neither side can truly win any advantage over the other, nor do they even remember why they fight, so what is the point? If there is no power to be gained, the battle is worthless.~
@1185 = ~What a horrible way to think! The true tragedy is the bloodshed and loss of life caused by the Blood War, not this twisted notion of gain and power!~
@1186 = ~I see your point. Still, there must be a reason beyond simple bloodlust that drives the Blood War on and on.~
@1187 = ~Ah, you're thinking too narrowly, Sarevok. Of course the fools dead on the battlefield gain nothing, but those above them - they gain much.~
@1188 = ~Uh...sure. Whatever you say.~
@1189 = ~You have no opinion on the matter?~
@1190 = ~Of course I do - I think that's a horrible way to think! The true tragedy is the bloodshed and loss of life caused by the Blood War, not this twisted notion of gain and power!~
@1191 = ~I believe you're thinking too narrowly, Sarevok. Of course the fools dead on the battlefield gain nothing, but those above them - they gain much.~
@1192 = ~Not really. No.~
@1193 = ~My apologies, dear sister.~
@1194 = ~Bah! Your compassion is pointless! No one in this world is innocent. Even with your empty head buried in the sand you must see that!~
@1195 = ~My head is not buried in the sand! I know what the world is really like, but to be crushed between two unstoppable forces, neither of which have anything to do with your life, is unjust!~
@1196 = ~You are a despicable man! You care for no one's loss but your own, and sometimes not even then!~
@1197 = ~I see it well enough, but that does not mean I have to accept it.~
@1198 = ~My head is buried in the sand? You are the one who believed he was destined to be a god and instead became a pile of ash!~
@1199 = ~Just shut up! I don't give a damn about your opinion!~
@1200 = ~Hah, scored a blow, did I? It sounds like you know much about such things.~
@1201 = ~I do not like what you imply.~
@1202 = ~You trample down everyone who ever cared for you, and it doesn't seem to even phase you!~
@1203 = ~Did you feel anything when you struck Winski down, Sarevok? What about when Tamoko died - or was she just another worthless death in the wake of your greatness?~
@1204 = ~Forget it. There's no point wasting my breath.~
@1205 = ~(sigh) Never mind.~
@1206 = ~You know not of what you speak, and so you should be silent.~
@1207 = ~Watch your tongue, fool, unless you wish to have it ripped from your mouth!~
@1208 = ~<CHARNAME>, denial does not change reality.~
@1209 = ~And yet...I now stand at your side.~
@1210 = ~Yes...it is a curious subject, is it not? Do the archdukes of the Hells or the princes of the Abyss keep the battles going for some unknown purpose, or perhaps the gods stir the conflict for their own reasons?~
@1211 = ~Probably the dukes and princes. Perhaps it amuses them to pit their forces against each other.~
@1212 = ~The gods most likely. They meddle constantly in everything else, why not the Blood War?~
@1213 = ~Maybe it's neither of them. Maybe there's another force entirely that drives them, something we know nothing of.~
@1214 = ~Perhaps it is simply habit. They've been killing each other for so long, they'd likely not know what to do with themselves if they weren't fighting.~
@1215 = ~I have absolutely no interest in this subject at all, let alone in your opinions.~
@1216 = ~Eventually amusement would run thin, <CHARNAME>, especially after all this time.~
@1217 = ~Hah, is that bitterness I hear in your voice?~
@1218 = ~That seems rather farfetched...though after all I have seen, nothing would surprise me.~
@1219 = ~Yes, I have entertained that notion myself. It does seem to make the most sense, all things considered.~
@1220 = ~The spoils of the victories of their underlings are too slight to matter at all in the grand scheme of the Blood War itself, and the cost of waging war far exceeds the rewards! That is hardly a worthy gain, <CHARNAME>.~
@1221 = ~Again, you think too narrowly! I'm not speaking of the dukes and princes that rule the baatezu and tanar'ri - I speak of the gods, Sarevok.~
@1222 = ~Ah, but gold is a fleeting thing, and blood...blood stains for generations, dear Sarevok. So, is the damage wrought by a never-ending war worth the gold? I say it is.~
@1223 = ~Perhaps you are right, but I still don't think the Blood War is useless.~
@1224 = ~Bah, I still say anything that breeds death is to be respected.~
@1225 = ~I just realized - I don't give a damn about your opinion, Sarevok. So shut up.~
@1226 = ~Explain.~
@1227 = ~The gods are the only real beings who stand to profit from such a thing as the Blood War. No matter the outcome of each battle, the ripples caused by that death and destruction travel through all the planes, shifting the balance of power. Surely you of all people see that.~
@1228 = ~The dark gods thrive off death and suffering, and the Blood War is the perfect engine for the generation of such power.~
@1229 = ~Bhaal would have needed no explanation. He would have reveled in the murder and blood instead of dissecting and questioning everything.~
@1230 = ~Bah, I won't waste my breath if you cannot see my point.~
@1231 = ~Interesting...but by that theory, the good deities gain as much from the Blood War as the evil. Which makes a surprising amount of sense, now that I think on it.~
@1232 = ~Perhaps. But if the dark gods alone profited, they would have gained an advantage by now over their rivals, so perhaps it is not the evil gods alone who have a stake in those skirmishes.~
@1233 = ~Yes. And Bhaal is dead now. That worked out well for him, didn't it?~
@1234 = ~A...curious way of thinking. Intriguing.~
@1235 = ~Ah, but I never said it was useless. I said it was pointless. There is a difference.~
@1236 = ~Father would be proud.~
@1237 = ~I wonder...will the Blood War ever end?~
@1238 = ~Why are you asking me?~
@1239 = ~Everything ends, Sarevok.~
@1240 = ~Probably not. They seem quite content with endless battles.~
@1241 = ~I care not either way.~
@1242 = ~I am curious. You defeated me, and perhaps I wish to know how you see things.~
@1243 = ~Very well, then. I think everything ends, Sarevok, the Blood War included.~
@1244 = ~To answer your question, I have no idea.~
@1245 = ~Then I think it will probably never end. They seem quite content with endless battles.~
@1246 = ~I don't care enough about the Blood War to have a theory.~
@1247 = ~You know, Sarevok, I'm sick of you trying to get inside my head, and I don't give a damn about your opinions either. Let's just go.~
@1248 = ~Yes...I am learning the truth of those words more and more.~
@1249 = ~(sigh) I hate not knowing.~
@1250 = ~Appearances can be deceiving.~
@1251 = ~Thank you for indulging my curiosity, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps we should continue on.~
@1252 = ~Ahahaha! Now *that* was a battle!~
@1253 = ~I-I think I n-need to change my pants...~
@1254 = ~Just another dead dragon.~
@1255 = ~It was pretty fun.~
@1256 = ~You fought well.~
@1257 = ~Hah! I could do that all day!~
@1258 = ~Hah, then it's good that you hid behind me like a frightened child.~
@1259 = ~Such arrogance.~
@1260 = ~It was a challenge - and I love a challenge.~
@1261 = ~As did you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1262 = ~(Sarevok is still breathing hard from adrenaline and exertion. His eyes smolder as he holds your gaze for a long, tense moment, and you might have imagined the way his body shifts toward you before he turns away.)~
@1263 = ~(Sarevok stands over the place where Demogorgon fell and leans on his sword to catch his breath.)~
@1264 = ~(Approach him.)~
@1265 = ~(Watch him from afar.)~
@1266 = ~(Turn back to the task at hand.)~
@1267 = ~(Sarevok remains that way for several minutes, staring at the floor with a blank look on his face, then shakes his head with an expression of bemusement and rejoins you without a word.)~
@1268 = ~(Sarevok's eyes flicker up to your face as you approach, and he shakes his head in as if in a daze.)~
@1269 = ~The Demon Prince Demogorgon. And we defeated him. We sent him back to the Abyss...~
@1270 = ~Amazing, isn't it?~
@1271 = ~I can't believe we survived...~
@1272 = ~I expected him to be stronger.~
@1273 = ~I could not allow his evil to escape.~
@1274 = ~You look stunned.~
@1275 = ~(Sarevok is staring at you intently as if he's trying to read something in your eyes.)~
@1276 = ~(All at once he practically lunges at you and his gloved hand closes around the back of your neck as his lips crash into yours in a harsh, demanding kiss.)~
@1277 = ~(Stand still.)~
@1278 = ~(Smack him.)~
@1279 = ~(Shove him away.)~
@1280 = ~(His hand tightens in your hair as you explore each other's mouths with greedy abandon, but soon he pushes you away, a low, hungry laugh rising up in his throat.)~
@1281 = ~(Sarevok's tongue slides against your lips tauntingly before he releases you with a rumble of dark laughter.)~
@1282 = ~(He catches your hand and holds you trapped against him for a moment before stepping back with a low, rumbling laugh.)~
@1283 = ~(He doesn't resist as you push him back, but he lets out a pleased laugh low in his throat.)~
@1284 = ~Ha-ha! There is nothing we cannot defeat together!~
@1285 = ~Come, <CHARNAME>, let us find a god to kill as well!~
@1286 = ~This woman Melissan knows much of the Children.~
@1287 = ~I think she's just trying to help.~
@1288 = ~She makes my skin crawl.~
@1289 = ~I noticed that.  It seems strange that someone who is not of Bhaal's blood would have so much interest.~
@1290 = ~Too much.~
@1291 = ~Manipulative bitch.  She's lucky she has the upper hand...for now.~
@1292 = ~It's amazing you have lived this long, <CHARNAME>.~
@1293 = ~You sense it as well?~
@1294 = ~At least you recognize that you are indeed being manipulated.~
@1295 = ~Do you trust what she says of this Yaga-Shura? An immortal giant, Child of Bhaal, and we are supposed to defeat him? It sounds like a fool's errand.~
@1296 = ~I don't see that she has any reason to lie.~
@1297 = ~I'm not sure, but we don't have much else to go on right now.~
@1298 = ~I don't trust her, but what else can we do?~
@1299 = ~Of course not. But we'll beat her at her own game.~
@1300 = ~I don't trust anyone, Sarevok.~
@1301 = ~What does it matter to you? You're here to kill the people I want killed and nothing else.~
@1302 = ~No reason? Gods woman, have you no sense at all? Just because you cannot see the reason, it does not exist?~
@1303 = ~Well of course not, but what's the point worrying over something that may or many not be real?~
@1304 = ~Maybe she does have an ulterior motive, but we can't do much about it now can we?~
@1305 = ~Why in the hells are you shouting at me?~
@1306 = ~Keep your voice down, fool, and mind your tongue!~
@1307 = ~Just shut up. You're here to kill the people I want killed and nothing else.~
@1308 = ~To make certain the words sink into your thick skull!~
@1309 = ~And stay silent as you lead us to our deaths? I think not.~
@1310 = ~Perhaps playing along is the right choice for now, but I cannot say I like it.~
@1311 = ~Then we are in agreement. Believe me, I want to know what's really going on as much as you do.~
@1312 = ~Hah, I cannot remember the last time I had to make a choice that I actually liked.~
@1313 = ~Gods above, is there anything you *do* like, Sarevok?~
@1314 = ~Don't worry. If this bitch is playing us for fools, she'll get what's coming to her.~
@1315 = ~That's great. Now am I done holding your hand? Can we get moving?~
@1316 = ~Yes...it comes with our birthright it seems.~
@1317 = ~Hah, most likely the things I enjoy would make you squeamish.~
@1318 = ~This is no game, fool, and even if it were, you don't know the rules or what is a stake!~
@1319 = ~I'm not a fool!~
@1320 = ~You know, I'm getting pretty damned tired of you calling me a fool.~
@1321 = ~I know exactly what's a stake, Sarevok. I have the scars to prove it.~
@1322 = ~Hah, as if that matters! I'll rewrite the rules and slit her throat wide open if she crosses us. Is that good enough for you?~
@1323 = ~Then perhaps you should stop behaving like one.~
@1324 = ~Then prove that you have learned something from those scars.~
@1325 = ~Hah, you think me a fool then. You turn your back to me daily, <CHARNAME>. Is that not trust?~
@1326 = ~I...I supposed it is, in some way.~
@1327 = ~I've never thought of it that way. I don't know.~
@1328 = ~That's...different.~
@1329 = ~No, not trust. Necessity.~
@1330 = ~Oh, please. I've killed you more times than I can remember. You honestly think I'd fear you at my back?~
@1331 = ~At least you admit it.~
@1332 = ~Is it?~
@1333 = ~Hah, I did not realize you needed me so badly, dear sister.~
@1334 = ~Be…careful with your words, <CHARNAME>…~
@1335 = ~You must not let yourself be blind to the dangers other people pose to you. Never turn your back on this woman.~
@1336 = ~Are you...worried about me?~
@1337 = ~Don't worry. I won't.~
@1338 = ~You're watching my back, though. Aren't you?~
@1339 = ~Whoa, wait. You're being protective.~
@1340 = ~I don't need a babysitter, Sarevok. I did just fine before you were around.~
@1341 = ~Be worried about your own back, fool, and leave me to tend to myself.~
@1342 = ~No, I...~
@1343 = ~You are far too trusting.~
@1344 = ~So you claim.~
@1345 = ~Your destiny is a fascinating one, <CHARNAME>. I would hate to see it cut short because of your own stupidity.~
@1346 = ~I'll try not to disappoint you.~
@1347 = ~I think there's more to it than idle curiosity.~
@1348 = ~Face it. You like me.~
@1349 = ~All this advice is a little odd coming from someone who's tried to kill me more times than I can count.~
@1350 = ~Since when do you care?~
@1351 = ~Whatever. Let's go.~
@1352 = ~Then perhaps your imagination is running away with you.~
@1353 = ~Yes, I'm utterly enthralled.~
@1354 = ~I cannot betray you, <CHARNAME>, so your paranoia is wasted.~
@1355 = ~Then don't take it.~
@1356 = ~Since the moment you brought me back from the dead and into this mess.~
@1357 = ~Vampires.~
@1358 = ~I hate vampires.~
@1359 = ~How observant.~
@1360 = ~Why is it always vampires?~
@1361 = ~They'll die just like everything else that stands in my way.~
@1362 = ~Don't tell me you're scared of a few shapeshifting bloodsuckers.~
@1363 = ~Terrified.~
@1364 = ~You don't seem overly surprised...have you had much experience with vampires?~
@1365 = ~More than I'd like.~
@1366 = ~Um...you could say that...~
@1367 = ~I worked with some back in Amn.~
@1368 = ~I spent months fighting against a large force of vampires back in Amn.~
@1369 = ~I don't see how that's any of your business. Let's get moving.~
@1370 = ~Just shut up and keep moving.~
@1371 = ~Meaning...?~
@1372 = ~A partnership with vampires? Interesting. How did it end?~
@1373 = ~In blood. The usual.~
@1374 = ~Let's just say I had a falling out with the leader. I knew working with her type would cost me, I just didn't realize it would cost me my soul. Well, technically Imoen's soul, but mine soon followed.~
@1375 = ~What makes you think it ended?~
@1376 = ~That's none of your business. Let's go.~
@1377 = ~An educated guess, as you are standing here and there are no vampires in your wake.~
@1378 = ~It ended in blood. The usual.~
@1379 = ~A true Daughter of Bhaal.~
@1380 = ~For what reason?~
@1381 = ~Many reasons. Namely, because their leader was in league with my true enemy.~
@1382 = ~It is my duty to fight against any evil which crosses my path.~
@1383 = ~The Shadow Thieves offered me the same information the vampires had, so I chose the lesser of two evils I guess.~
@1384 = ~For fun. Why else?~
@1385 = ~Because their leader was an egotistical bitch and she needed to be taken down off her high horse.~
@1386 = ~Does it matter?~
@1387 = ~Enough of this chatter. Let's get moving.~
@1388 = ~Hah, is that a veiled threat I sense, dear sister?~
@1389 = ~Hmm...is that jealousy I hear? Hah, how your eyes flash when you're angry!~
@1390 = ~It seems you have been busy in my absence. Perhaps you will tell me more some other time.~
@1391 = ~(After the battle, your eyes happen to fall on Sarevok. His face is pale and he seems shaken, though he is struggling to hide his discomfort under a cold scowl.)~
@1392 = ~What in the hells is wrong with you? Get a grip!~
@1393 = ~(Draw him aside.) Are you okay?~
@1394 = ~(Watch him but say nothing.)~
@1395 = ~(Ignore him and move on.)~
@1396 = ~(You can almost hear his teeth grinding together as he glowers at you.)~
@1397 = ~(Sarevok jerks away from your touch, a fierce sneer on his face as he towers over you.)~
@1398 = ~(His eyes snap up to meet your gaze, and though his face goes blank, his eyes are filled with something dark and haunted.)~
@1399 = ~Are we finished here?~
@1400 = ~I suppose so.~
@1401 = ~Are you going to be okay?~
@1402 = ~I'm sorry. That can't have been easy for you.~
@1403 = ~Pull yourself together! I have no need of man who is cowed by the notion of fighting some pathetic shades of former allies.~
@1404 = ~Yes, we are.~
@1405 = ~Why do you bother to ask me this?~
@1406 = ~Do you think your false sympathies will wear me down? That I will pour myself out to you? Get away from me!~
@1407 = ~My sympathies are not false, and I don't want to wear you down. I want to help you.~
@1408 = ~My sympathies are not false, but you could certainly use some wearing down. Particularly that overgrown pride.~
@1409 = ~Fighting those things could not have been easy, Sarevok. Especially after those things said by Tamoko's shade...~
@1410 = ~(sigh) Very well then. We're finished here.~
@1411 = ~Curb your tongue, you arrogant bastard!~
@1412 = ~Let's go.~
@1413 = ~You are *not* helping. All you have managed to do is anger me, though perhaps that was your intention all along.~
@1414 = ~You arrogantly believe I wish to speak to you of this, and you accuse *me* of pride?~
@1415 = ~And I have no need of your lectures, fool.~
@1416 = ~Enough of this.~
@1417 = ~And yet you have replaced those you've lost with one who stole my very life away, and sought yours as well. Sarevok's ambition knows no bounds, and now it seems you share his callous disregard for the lives of others.~
@1418 = ~I warned you, old fool. I will not-~
@1419 = ~My words may fall on deaf ears, Sarevok, but what of the voices of those you have murdered? Though...perhaps only one voice will serve to open your eyes...~
@1420 = ~Wh...where...Sarevok?~ [ls#blank]
@1421 = ~No...Tamoko? What foul treachery is this...?~
@1422 = ~You betrayed me, Sarevok. You murdered me.~
@1423 = ~What?! You...no, you cannot be Tamoko!~
@1424 = ~What then must I say to make you believe? Must I recite our promises, your whispered vows, now all broken and wasted. How you swore I would stand by your side, no matter what came. How I believed in you, in your dreams. How-~
@1425 = ~Silence! I will hear no more!~
@1426 = ~I should not be surprised. You never cared overmuch for the lives of those who followed you. We were naught but pawns to you, were we, my murderer?~
@1427 = ~I did not murder you!~
@1428 = ~Oh, but you did, my love. Your hand did not wield the blade that pierced my shattered heart, but my true death began long before that day, and what a slow, painful death it was...~
@1429 = ~What madness is this...?~
@1430 = ~I loved you, Sarevok. I would have done anything, everything to please even your slightest whim. I murdered in your name proudly. Yet that was not enough.~
@1431 = ~You turned your back on me! You stood against the one thing I desired most!~
@1432 = ~Why could I not be what you desired most? I did not want to lose you. And I was, Sarevok, I was losing you to Bhaal more and more every day. You sent me to die because you could not stand to see your reflection in my eyes...an image of the man you used to be before Bhaal consumed your heart.~
@1433 = ~I...bah! This is not to be believed!~
@1434 = ~That was not the worst of your betrayals, though, my murderer. Tell me, Sarevok, did you think of me when you bedded her? Did Cythandria whisper her love in your ears as you fell asleep in her arms, just as I once did?~
@1435 = ~Enough!~
@1436 = ~It was the death of our love that killed me, the sentence carried out by your hands, your actions, your ambition. Your cruelty destroyed me, the one person who loved you more than any other. Perhaps the only person who truly loved you at all.~
@1437 = ~I welcomed the end when it finally came. It freed me from the torment you brought upon me.~
@1438 = ~Tamoko...I...~
@1439 = ~Stop, Tamoko! He isn't responsible for what happened to you!~
@1440 = ~Stop this, Gorion! He doesn't deserve this!~
@1441 = ~Enough! I won't allow this to continue!~
@1442 = ~It's a lie, Sarevok! Don't believe it!~
@1443 = ~(Sarevok Anchev, murderer, deceiver and your former nemesis, stands proud and alert not far from you.)~ [ls#blank]
@1444 = ~(Study him.)~
@1445 = ~(Feign disinterest, but watch him from the corner of your eye.)~
@1446 = ~(Turn away.)~
@1447 = ~(It would be easy to consider Sarevok handsome - if it weren't for the perpetual scowl and deathly coldness in his eyes. He gives the impression that he is simply waiting for an excuse to kill someone. Anyone, really.)~
@1448 = ~(A long, broken scar runs from his brow, down his left cheek, and nearly cuts into the corner of his mouth, only one of many such marks branded into his dark skin. These scars and the crisscrossing tattoos etched into his scalp only serve to make the tall, muscular man all the more intimidating.)~
@1449 = ~(Your eyes allow you to watch him closely even from this angle, yet Sarevok's expression and posture are difficult to read. He is always tense, always alert, always suspicious, and his own wary sidelong glances at you prove that all the more.)~
@1450 = ~(You cannot see much from this angle, but experience would say that Sarevok is a difficult man to read.  He is always tense, always alert, always suspicious, and the wary sidelong glance you catch him sending your direction proves that all the more.)~
@1451 = ~Is there a reason you cannot take your eyes from me?~
@1452 = ~Not really. Curiosity perhaps.~
@1453 = ~W-what are you talking about? I wasn't watching you.~
@1454 = ~Shouldn't I keep an eye on you? You are a murderer, after all.~
@1455 = ~I'm not really sure to be honest.~
@1456 = ~No. I just want to look at you.~
@1457 = ~Does it bother you?~
@1458 = ~No. Let's get moving.~
@1459 = ~I see. And do you always waste your time on idle curiosity?~
@1460 = ~Well...no, not always.~
@1461 = ~I think I should get to know you better if you're going to be fighting at my back.~
@1462 = ~Yep, that's me. I'm always distracted by something. Sometimes I walk right into walls when I see something shiny on the ground. Ooo, look! A gold piece!~
@1463 = ~I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bother you.~
@1464 = ~Tell me, are you spineless or simply a fool?~
@1465 = ~I was only curious about you is all.~
@1466 = ~Spineless most likely.~
@1467 = ~A fool - absolutely.~
@1468 = ~I-I-I...just...~
@1469 = ~So I was watching you. I'd be a fool if I didn't keep an eye on a known murderer.~
@1470 = ~Neither, and your insults are meaningless.~
@1471 = ~Bah! Why do I waste my time on weaklings?~
@1472 = ~I am what I am. Staring at me changes nothing.~
@1473 = ~If you desired a guarantee of my loyalty, you should have taken my oath when you had the chance. As things stand, you'll just have to accept the risk.~
@1474 = ~That's not exactly reassuring.~
@1475 = ~Was it a mistake to take you along with me?~
@1476 = ~True enough, I suppose.~
@1477 = ~I cannot believe you have no regret for all the deaths you've caused...for Gorion...~
@1478 = ~You have my oath, <CHARNAME>. Even should I wish to betray you, I cannot.~
@1479 = ~Only a fool does anything without a purpose.~
@1480 = ~So what 'purpose' has you following me around, hmm?~
@1481 = ~Then color me foolish. Now could you be a dear and turn back around? I wasn't finished staring at you.~
@1482 = ~My 'purpose' is doing whatever I want. And I want to look at you.~
@1483 = ~Fine then. I'm purposely keeping an eye on the known murderer at my side.~
@1484 = ~Am I bothering you?~
@1485 = ~And why is that?~
@1486 = ~Er...no reason.~
@1487 = ~Don't play coy. You're a handsome man and I'm sure you're used to drawing stares.~
@1488 = ~You're what? Ten feet tall? It's kind of hard not to stare.~
@1489 = ~Because I like looking at you.~
@1490 = ~I'm not really sure.~
@1491 = ~I'm not the type of fool who turns their back on a known murderer.~
@1492 = ~I...see.~
@1493 = ~I see trying to get a sensible explanation out of you is pointless.~
@1494 = ~Is this the kind of idiocy I should look forward to our entire time together?~
@1495 = ~You're free to leave whenever you want, Sarevok.~
@1496 = ~I will gladly release you from your oath and let you do whatever you please. Just give the word.~
@1497 = ~You're the sucker who gave me an oath. Shut up and stop complaining.~
@1498 = ~You pretty much begged me to let you come along, so you only have yourself to blame.~
@1499 = ~Don't worry. You'll learn to love me. Everyone else does.~
@1500 = ~Yeah, ain't it great?~
@1501 = ~Until you out live your usefulness, yes.~
@1502 = ~The only thing that bothers me is the way you avoid answering me.~
@1503 = ~Fine, the truth is I like looking at you.~
@1504 = ~You're a murderer, Sarevok. I'd be a fool not to watch you.~
@1505 = ~Very well. The truth is you're just so damned gorgeous that I can't tear my eyes off you! Those tattoos, those eyes! Catch me before I swoon!~
@1506 = ~I can't give you an answer because I'm not really sure myself, Sarevok.~
@1507 = ~The only thing you need to know is that you are still useful to me. For now.~
@1508 = ~I will tell you nothing. Let's move on.~
@1509 = ~Do not waste your time with threats. I will prove a valuable asset, dear sister.~
@1510 = ~Find me something to kill.~
@1511 = ~You expect me to believe you would simply let me loose on the realms again?~
@1512 = ~I shall take that as a yes.~
@1513 = ~At least you are wise enough to admit it.~
@1514 = ~Save your breath. I am not here for redemption.~
@1515 = ~If reassurances are what you seek, sister, then this is all I can offer you. I desire nothing but the chance to watch what you will make of yourself, and perhaps take a piece of the power that travels in your wake.~
@1516 = ~In the past you manipulated those around you in order to further your own goals and place yourself as the dominant power. I should assume that you will try the same again - not to take a piece of said power, but to take it all.~
@1517 = ~I'm not stupid, Sarevok. You've always been manipulative and power hungry. Why would I expect you to accept a piece of the power if there was a way for you to take it all?~

@1519 = ~Well, I'll try to give you a good show then. Let's go.~
@1520 = ~Somehow that doesn't make me feel much better.~
@1521 = ~You're right. You *are* the wrong man to go to for reassurances.~
@1522 = ~And if I were willing to share more than my power with you?~
@1523 = ~Whatever you say. Get moving.~
@1524 = ~Hah, so you are not the fool I took you for? Intriguing.~
@1525 = ~You have taken quite the risk bringing me with you, though I doubt you need a reminder of that, dear sister.~
@1526 = ~Then I would remind you that I am no fool, dear sister, and I do not let my guard down so easily.~

@1553 = ~Tell me about Cythandria.~
@1554 = ~What did you think of Gromnir?~

@1564 = ~(The moment you turn your eyes toward him, Sarevok looks your direction and raises an eyebrow questioningly.)~
@1565 = ~(You meet Sarevok's eyes and it becomes clear he's been watching you for some time. He stares back at you with a challenging look.)~
@1566 = ~(Smile.)~
@1567 = ~(Make a face.)~
@1568 = ~(Keep staring.)~
@1569 = ~See something you like?~
@1570 = ~(Look away.)~
@1571 = ~(Sarevok frowns then turns his eyes away from you. It's possible you imagined the odd discomfort you spotted on his face.)~
@1572 = ~(After sticking out your tongue and crossing your eyes, you refocus and realize that Sarevok has moved on ahead of the group. His scowl is deeper than usual.)~
@1573 = ~(Your eyes grow dry as you stare at each other stubbornly, but a sudden, out of place sound brings you both back to the present, forcing an end to your stalemate. When Sarevok glances back at you, the corner of his mouth is turned up in the barest hint of a smirk.)~
@1574 = ~I am not certain. Perhaps I shall keep watching until I am.~
@1575 = ~(Sarevok is checking the clasps of his armor, leaving you free to gaze at him at your leisure.)~
@1576 = ~(Study his face.)~
@1577 = ~(Study his hands.)~
@1578 = ~(Study his backside.)~
@1579 = ~(Sarevok is handsome enough, but his scowl makes him look hostile and disagreeable, and he wears it so frequently that it's hard to imagine him smiling. Or having any other expression at all, for that matter.)~
@1580 = ~(Sarevok's dark eyes are hooded in shadows, so very different from the golden glow he possessed when the taint flowed through his blood. He looks much more human now than he did then.)~
@1581 = ~(Sarevok's jaw is set in a stubborn, uncompromising line, an expression you've only even seen one other place: a mirror.)~
@1582 = ~(You eyes are drawn to the tattoos crisscrossing his bald scalp, and it is hard not to wonder if they have any significance or if they are merely decorative. Or perhaps if he has similar markings on other parts of his body...)~
@1583 = ~(The most noticeable feature on Sarevok's face is his scars. So many of them, some shallow, some deep, some so old they've faded beneath the newer ones. A jagged line cuts through his left eyebrow, and two others scissors across the bridge of his nose.)~
@1584 = ~(It's the face of a man who has seen more battles than he can count.)~
@1585 = ~(Sarevok has removed his gloves, and you spend a moment watching his long, strong fingers work over his armor. His grip never slips and his fingers never fumble, and it takes very little time for him to complete his check before he's ready to move on.)~
@1586 = ~(You can see the expansive calluses on Sarevok's palms even from this distance. His hands must be as tough as leather.)~
@1587 = ~(Sarevok has enormous hands, large enough to dwarf the hands of an average human man, yet just as the rest of his body, he moves them with a deft grace that is likely some combination of natural instinct and rigid training.)~
@1588 = ~(And what a backside it is. Even with the armor in the way, it's obvious Sarevok has a back and thighs that not even the most skilled sculptor could justly replicate.)~
@1589 = ~(Just as you move to get a better angle, Sarevok bends to adjust his boots, giving you a spectacular view of his armor-clad rear.)~
@1590 = ~(Just as you move to get a better angle, Sarevok turns to you as if to speak, and immediately notices where your attention was focused. He frowns and swallows whatever it was he wanted to say as he turns away, but not before he can hide the curiosity in his eyes.)~
@1591 = ~Fool.~
@1592 = ~(Sarevok ignores you.)~
@1593 = ~(Sarevok offers you a bone-chilling smile in return.)~
@1594 = ~Do you think your childish nonsense will put me at ease?~
@1595 = ~(Sarevok gives you a dry stare.)~
@1596 = ~Enjoyed killing that last pack of fools? Aye, I thought you might.~
@1597 = ~(Sarevok looks as though he's doubting your sanity.)~
@1598 = ~(You have barely raised your hand when Sarevok spins your direction, his body tensed for a fight.)~
@1599 = ~Are you mad? Play your games with someone else!~
@1600 = ~(Your hand comes to rest briefly on Sarevok's forearm, but he doesn't acknowledge you as he stares straight ahead.)~
@1601 = ~(Sarevok moves aside as your hand approaches, though nothing in his expression reveals if this was by accident or design.)~
@1602 = ~(Sarevok looks down at your hand on his shoulder, then up at your face as if he's expecting the Slayer to emerge and dismember him. When nothing happens, the man sighs irritably and shrugs off your hand before stalking away.)~
@1603 = ~I am glad you think so highly of your own opinion.~
@1604 = ~Do you go out of your way to be irritating or is it something you cannot control?~
@1605 = ~Hah! Would you have said the same of me a year ago? Fickle woman.~
@1606 = ~I...thank you, <CHARNAME>...~
@1607 = ~(It's unclear how anyone can look so foul-tempered while accepting a compliment.)~
@1608 = ~(Sarevok proves just how excellent his reflexes truly are - by stepping aside to let you land roughly on the ground.)~
@1609 = ~(Sarevok moves aside as you try to nudge him, though nothing in his expression reveals if he was even aware of your intentions.)~
@1610 = ~(You miss your target, trip and sprawl inelegantly on the ground.)~
@1611 = ~(Sarevok lifts an eyebrow at you and steps over your prone form without a word.)~
@1612 = ~(Sarevok sighs and offers you his hand. He pulls you to your feet so roughly that you nearly topple over again.)~
@1613 = ~How in the Nine Hells is it possible that you defeated me in battle?~
@1614 = ~(If Sarevok has noticed your plight, he gives no indication of caring whatsoever.)~
@1615 = ~(You misstep and stumble forcefully into Sarevok.)~
@1616 = ~(Sarevok shrugs you off and you nearly fall, but he keeps walking as if nothing happened.)~
@1617 = ~(Sarevok straightens you roughly, a dark scowl on his face.)~
@1618 = ~Your incompetence is truly astounding.~
@1619 = ~Gods, woman, I take more injuries from you than from our enemies.~
@1620 = ~I feel your eyes on me, <CHARNAME>. Am I truly such a distraction?~
@1621 = ~(Sarevok's gaze flickers away from you, but he looks quickly back and offers a forced half-smile that resembles a grimace of pain more than any expression of pleasure.)~
@1622 = ~(Sarevok is handsome enough, but his customary scowl makes him appear hostile and disagreeable. Lately, however, his most common expression is a slight, thoughtful frown.)~
@1623 = ~(Sarevok's dark eyes are hooded in shadows, so very different from the golden glow he had when the taint flowed through his blood. He looks much more human now than he did then.)~
@1624 = ~(You eyes are drawn to the tattoos crisscrossing his bald scalp, and it's hard not to wonder if they have any significance or if they are merely decorative. Or perhaps if he has similar markings on other parts of his body...)~
@1625 = ~(The most noticeable feature on Sarevok's face is his scars. So many of them, some shallow, some deep, some so old they've faded beneath the newer ones. A jagged line cuts through his left eyebrow and down his cheek, and two others scissor across the bridge of his nose.)~
@1626 = ~(Sarevok has removed his gloves, and you spend a moment watching his long, scarred fingers work over his armor. His grip never slips and his fingers never fumble, and it takes very little time for him to complete his check before he's ready to move on.)~
@1627 = ~(You can see the expansive calluses on Sarevok's palms even from this distance. His hands must be tough as leather.)~
@1628 = ~(Sarevok has enormous hands, large enough to dwarf the hands of the average human man, yet just as with the rest of his body, he moves them with a deft grace that is likely some combination of natural instinct and rigid training.)~
@1629 = ~(Just as you move to get a better angle, Sarevok turns to you as if to speak, and immediately notices where your attention was focused. He raises an eyebrow curiously, then moves around the back of you, eyeing your bottom with a lustful smirk that puts your own efforts to shame.)~
@1630 = ~(Sarevok sighs and turns away.)~
@1631 = ~You really are as mad as Cyric.~
@1632 = ~(It's unclear if his returned expression is a smile or a sneer.)~
@1633 = ~Enjoyed killing that last pack of fools?  Aye, I thought you might.~
@1634 = ~Are you mad? Are you *trying* to get yourself killed?~
@1635 = ~(Sarevok shifts toward you as you reach for him, so instead of touching his shoulder you end up caressing the back of his neck. He raises an eyebrow at you, but the faint twitch at the corner of his mouth is a telltale sign that his move toward you was not accidental.)~
@1636 = ~(As your hand rests on Sarevok's chest, he looks down at you with a wary expression that slowly relaxes. You barely feel the brush of his fingers against the back of your hand before he moves away.)~
@1637 = ~(You reach up to gently caress Sarevok's jaw with your fingertips. He frowns slightly, but his eyes stay fixed on yours as you feel the rough stubble and warm skin underneath. His voice is quiet as he searches your gaze.)~
@1638 = ~What are you looking for, <CHARNAME>? No, do not answer. Whatever it is, you will not find it here.~
@1639 = ~(Sarevok has sat down for a moment to adjust the equipment in his pack, giving you the prime opportunity to examine the tattoos crossing his scalp. You sidle up beside him and run your fingertips lightly over the markings on his warm skin.)~
@1640 = ~(Sarevok's hands freeze and he goes very still for several seconds before he continues his adjustments, but he does not move away from your touch or look up at you, leaving you free to touch him at your whim.)~
@1641 = ~(Finally, when he has completed his task, he leans away from you and stands, but it's very obvious that he's avoiding looking you in the eye.)~
@1642 = ~(Sarevok ogles your backside.) I was just thinking the same thing.~
@1643 = ~And while you distract me with platitudes, our enemies could surround us and slit your throat.~
@1644 = ~(Sarevok proves just how excellent his reflexes truly are as he steps aside to let you fall flat on your face.)~
@1645 = ~(Instead of meeting the ground, however, you feel strong arms catch you mid-fall and he straightens you in one fluid movement before moving on without so much as a glance.)~
@1646 = ~(Sarevok cocks his head to one side and gives your sprawled body a long, lingering stare.)~
@1647 = ~(Sarevok sighs and offers you his hand. It's possible you imagined the way his touch lingered a moment longer than necessary.)~
@1648 = ~The longer I know you, <CHARNAME>, the more I believe my defeat was an accident.~
@1649 = ~(Sarevok straightens you roughly, but his hand stays on the small of your back for longer than needed.)~
@1650 = ~Looking for an excuse to touch me?~
@1651 = ~(Apparently hugging a man wearing full platemail is as cold and uncomfortable as it sounds. Sarevok seems content to let you discover this for yourself, and his expression is almost smug when you eventually withdraw.)~
@1652 = ~(You catch Sarevok during a very rare moment when he is not wearing armor. Your arms slide easily around his waist and you can feel his body heat through his shirt. Though he does not return the embrace, you can feel the tingling warmth of his breath against your neck as he leans close and speaks.)~
@1653 = ~You are far too trusting, <CHARNAME>.~
@1654 = ~Unhand me! I am not your nursemaid!~
@1655 = ~You know, these things are much more pleasant without armor. Or clothing.~
@1656 = ~(Sarevok sighs but stands completely still as you wrap your arms around him. When you eventually withdraw, he is frowning, the expression equal parts irritation and confusion.)~
@1657 = ~(You move up beside Sarevok, intending to plant a kiss on his cheek, but his hand snaps up with dizzying speed, clamping your throat in a powerful grip that could snap a man's neck.)~
@1658 = ~(He blinks when he realizes that you are not an enemy, and backs away as he releases your bruised throat.)~
@1659 = ~What in the hells were you thinking? Never mind - as usual, you were not.~
@1660 = ~(Sarevok's lips are warm and dry as you press a kiss against them. He does not respond, but when you pull away he gives you a bemused, if annoyed, look.)~
@1661 = ~(You lean up to press a gentle kiss against Sarevok's cheek, and he shakes his head as you pull away.)~
@1662 = ~I would ask what that was for, <CHARNAME>, but the answer would likely make me question your sanity even more.~
@1663 = ~(Your body presses against Sarevok's chest as you brush a faint, teasing kiss across his lips, lingering but a hairsbreadth from his face as you stare into his eyes.)~
@1664 = ~(There's no time to react as he grabs you roughly by the arms and shoves you against the nearest solid object, his lips crashing down on yours in a demanding, bruising kiss.)~
@1665 = ~(Then, just as suddenly, he pulls back from you. Though his eyes are dark with desire and a little annoyance, Sarevok flashes you an evil grin before walking away.)~
@1666 = ~(Cradling Sarevok's face between your hands, you press a firm kiss against his full lips. He responds, sliding his hands around your waist to pull you closer and deepens the kiss, his tongue flickering teasingly against your lips.)~
@1667 = ~(Just when you begin to lose yourself in the pleasure of the kiss, Sarevok bites down fiercely on your lower lip, not hard enough to do any permanent damage but the pain is startling. He pushes you away and gives you a warning look.)~
@1668 = ~I am not here for your amusement, <CHARNAME>.~
@1669 = ~(Sarevok is staring off into the distance, but his focus snaps to your face as soon as you approach. When you try to lean in to kiss him, he pushes you away, though his touch is gentle and somewhat reluctant as he holds you at arm's length. His eyes are dark and unreadable as he shakes his head.)~
@1670 = ~(Sarevok's lips are unresponsive at first, but with a bit of persistence, he begins to return the kiss. One hand slides around to press the small of your back, molding your body against his as a small growl of approval rumbles up in his chest.)~
@1671 = ~(All at once he shoves you away, scowling fiercely as he backs off. Sarevok looks as if he wants to say something biting and cruel, but amazingly he seems speechless for the moment.)~
@1672 = ~Cannot take your eyes from me, can you? I know the feeling.~
@1673 = ~(The moment you turn your eyes toward him, Sarevok looks your direction. His eyes hold your gaze steadily though his expression is unreadable.)~
@1674 = ~(Sarevok shakes his head but the corners of his mouth twitch suspiciously. He turns away quickly to hide his amusement.)~
@1675 = ~(After sticking out your tongue and crossing your eyes, you refocus and realize that Sarevok has moved to stand directly in front of you. He raises his hand and traces an uneven line down your cheek with one gloved finger.)~
@1676 = ~You are the strangest woman I have ever known.~
@1677 = ~(It's unclear if he means his words as an insult or a compliment.)~
@1678 = ~(Only seconds pass before Sarevok clears the distance between you, grabs your chin firmly in one hand, and plants a ravening kiss on your lips. When he pulls back, there is an equal measure of longing and frustration in his eyes.)~
@1679 = ~Why can I not resist you? It is...infuriating.~
@1680 = ~(Sarevok is a handsome man, even more so now that he scowls less often. His expressions are proud and determined, but his disagreeable tendencies seem to have faded, at least for the time being.)~
@1681 = ~(You can see the expansive calluses on Sarevok's palms even from this distance. Your mind wanders to recent memories of those rough hands on your skin, and you are forced to turn away lest you forget your current task entirely.)~
@1682 = ~(And what a backside it is. Even with the armor in the way, you know from firsthand experience that Sarevok has a back and thighs that not even the most skilled sculptor could justly replicate.)~
@1683 = ~(Just as you move to get a better angle, Sarevok turns to you as if to speak, and immediately notices where your attention was focused. He chuckles under his breath, then pulls you against his chest, patting your bottom fondly as he places a slow, lingering kiss on your mouth.)~
@1684 = ~It pleases me to see you so happy.~
@1685 = ~(Perhaps he was aiming for biting sarcasm, but his words lack their usual sting.)~
@1686 = ~(Sarevok offers you a rueful smile in return.)~
@1687 = ~(Sarevok frowns.)~
@1688 = ~Do not test me, <CHARNAME>!~
@1689 = ~(Your hand comes to rest briefly on Sarevok's forearm, and though he does not look at you, the weight of his hand brushing over the top of yours, brief though it is, brings a sense of comfort.)~
@1690 = ~(Sarevok moves toward you as you reach for him, so instead of touching his shoulder you end up caressing the back of his neck. He raises an eyebrow at you, then dips forward to place a fleeting, feather-light kiss upon your lips.)~
@1691 = ~(As your hand rests on Sarevok's chest, he looks down at you with a gentle expression that you could not have imaged but a year or two earlier. You barely feel the brush of his fingers against the back of your hand before he moves away.)~
@1692 = ~(You reach up to gently caress Sarevok's jaw with your fingertips. His face is expressionless and his eyes stay fixed on yours as you feel the rough stubble and warm skin underneath. His voice is quiet and a little forced as he searches your gaze.)~
@1693 = ~Find what you were looking for, <CHARNAME>?~
@1694 = ~(Sarevok has sat down for a moment to adjust the equipment in his pack, giving you the prime opportunity to trace the tattoos crossing his scalp. You sidle up beside him and run your fingertips lightly over the markings on his warm skin.)~
@1695 = ~(Sarevok's hands freeze and he goes very still for several seconds, but suddenly he is on his feet, your hands now captured behind your back in one of his as he pins you against his chest. His other hand delves into your hair, pulling insistently until you expose your throat to his eager lips and tongue.)~
@1696 = ~(Still holding you trapped against him, he nips at your collarbone, then pulls away to stare into your eyes, a wolfish grin on his flushed face.)~
@1697 = ~Have you not realized by now that I am a dangerous man to tease, <CHARNAME>?~
@1698 = ~I...am glad you think so, <CHARNAME>.~
@1699 = ~(Instead of meeting the ground, however, you feel strong arms catch you mid-fall. Sarevok takes advantage of the opportunity to admire your cleavage and grope your backside before he straightens you and keeps walking.)~
@1700 = ~(Sarevok sighs and offers you his hand. Despite his irritated expression, he takes a moment to help you brush off the dust that clings to you before moving on.)~
@1701 = ~It must be your unnatural grace that attracts me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1702 = ~I swear you are doing this on purpose.~
@1703 = ~(Sarevok sees you coming and catches you roughly against his chest in a tight embrace. Though being pressed against hard, cold armor is not exactly pleasant, the deep, passionate kiss he demands from you possibly makes up for it.)~
@1704 = ~(Sarevok straightens you roughly, but his hand remains on the small of your back for a moment, then brushes down over your bottom possessively before he strides ahead of you.)~
@1705 = ~You do not need an excuse to touch me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1706 = ~Wait until we rest, <CHARNAME>.~
@1707 = ~(You catch Sarevok during a very rare moment when he is not wearing armor. Your arms slide easily around his waist and you can feel his body heat through his shirt. After a moment of hesitation, he returns the embrace, curling his powerful arms around your shoulders.)~
@1708 = ~(No words are exchanged as you share a moment of fragile comfort.)~
@1709 = ~(Sarevok sighs but stands completely still as you wrap your arms around him. When you eventually withdraw, he is frowning thoughtfully and avoiding your eyes.)~
@1710 = ~(His eyes widen when he realizes whom it is he holds, and he pulls you protectively against his chest as he tries to soothe your bruised flesh with a light brush of his lips.)~
@1711 = ~Do not test me like this.~
@1712 = ~(Sarevok's lips are warm and dry as you press a kiss against them. His fingers play through your hair and caress the back of your neck before you pull away to see a strange emotion that can only be described as reluctant contentment in his eyes.)~
@1713 = ~I should not find your antics amusing.~
@1714 = ~(There's no time to react as he grabs you roughly by the arms and shoves you against the nearest solid object, his lips crashing down on yours in a hard, bruising kiss. His voice comes out demanding and breathless in between kisses.)~
@1715 = ~You vixen. Call for a rest or I shall have my way with you right here.~
@1716 = ~(You both lose yourself in the pleasure of the kiss, your bodies melding together as close as your garments and armor will allow. A loud sound nearby breaks off your enjoyment, however, but Sarevok's smoldering gaze holds a promise to be fulfilled as soon as possible.)~
@1717 = ~(Sarevok is staring off into the distance, but his focus snaps to your face as soon as you approach. When you try to lean in to kiss him, he holds you at arm's length, his eyes flickering over your face, drinking in your visage with an indecipherable expression.)~
@1718 = ~You have the face of a goddess.~
@1719 = ~(During a brief rest, you take the opportunity to slide your fingers beneath the collar of Sarevok's breastplate in an attempt to relax his rock-hard shoulders. There's little room in there to do any actual good, but when you withdraw your hands, Sarevok catches them in his own and places a kiss on each of your palms.)~
@1720 = ~(Sarevok is busy cleaning the blood and grime from his armor and does not acknowledge you as you walk up behind him. His shoulders are as hard as marble under you touch, but after a few moments, he lets his armor slide from his grasp and lowers his chin to his chest with a groan.)~
@1721 = ~(When you finish your ministrations, Sarevok catches you by the arm and draws you onto his lap, sealing your lips with a deep, slow kiss.)~
@1722 = ~(The moment you touch him, Sarevok scowls and brushes your hand aside.)~
@1723 = ~Not now.~
@1724 = ~(You spend several minutes working the knots and tension from Sarevok's back, and listening to his appreciative groans. When you finish, he turns you around and returns the favor, his touch surprisingly tender and his fingers strong and skilled against the aches and pains of your back. He finishes his task with a faint kiss pressed against the base of your neck.)~
@1725 = ~Do not distract me. There could be danger.~
@1726 = ~(You've spend the better part of the last several hours making certain Sarevok gets a nice view of some of the more intimate parts of your body, although his face has remained stoic each time you catch him staring.)~
@1727 = ~(All at once you feel an arm snake around your waist, drawing your backside firmly against the front of a hard, armored body. Sarevok's voice rumbles in your ear.)~
@1728 = ~If it is your desire that I throw you on the ground and ravish you for all eyes to see, then by all means, keep this up.~
@1729 = ~One of these days, your antics will get us both killed.~
@1730 = ~(A smudge of grime on Sarevok's cheek provides an opportunity to get close to him. He watches with a raised eyebrow as you pull a worn cloth from your pack and wet it with a few drops of water.)~
@1731 = ~(He remains perfectly still as you stand only a hairsbreadth from him and slowly clean the dirt from his face. His gaze stays on your eyes, then trails down to your mouth and lingers there.)~
@1732 = ~If you call for a rest, I will gladly show you other places in need of your attention as well.~
@1733 = ~(Sarevok is pointedly ignoring your every attempt to get his attention.)~
@1734 = ~(You find yourself relatively alone with Sarevok for the moment.)~
@1735 = ~(Flash him.)~
@1736 = ~(Grope him.)~
@1737 = ~(Whisper in his ear.)~
@1738 = ~(Brush against him.)~
@1739 = ~(Leave him alone for now.)~
@1740 = ~(Sarevok glances your way just in time to catch more than an eyeful of your naked flesh, and for once his keen reflexes fail him. He stumbles, but catches himself with a muttered oath, then sends an irritated glare your direction.)~
@1741 = ~You should try doing that to our enemies instead. The diversion will make it much easier for me to cleave their heads from their shoulders.~
@1742 = ~(Sarevok sighs and pulls you roughly against him, one arm holding you pinned against his chest.)~
@1743 = ~You are a distraction. Not an entirely unwelcome one, but a distraction nonetheless.~
@1744 = ~(Sarevok stares at you passively for a moment, then shakes his head with a mocking smirk.) Must I truly point out that I am wearing armor and cannot feel your touch?~
@1745 = ~(Sarevok pulls restlessly away from your touch.) Not now.~
@1746 = ~(You take advantage of the fact that Sarevok is not wearing his armor for the moment and let your fingers eagerly explore the hard slope of his shoulders, the lines of his chest, the rippling power of his muscular stomach...)~
@1747 = ~(Before your touch can drop lower, he snatches your wrist in a firm grip.)~
@1748 = ~Do...not...tease me.~
@1749 = ~This is not the time for your games, <CHARNAME>.~
@1750 = ~I will hold you to that promise when next we rest, <CHARNAME>.~
@1751 = ~(Sarevok says nothing as you lean in to whisper something suggestive in his ear, but you cannot help but notice the small smile that twitches the corner of his mouth.)~
@1752 = ~(Putting an exaggerated sway into your walk, you saunter past Sarevok, making certain he feels the suggestive brush of your body against his. He says nothing, but his eyes, dark and smoldering, are locked on you each time you look his direction.)~
@1753 = ~(Your plans are foiled when you feel a sharp pain on your hand - a pointed ridge on Sarevok's armor catches you as you brush past and draws a painful welt across your skin. Sarevok notices and scoops your hand up to press a kiss against it, but he's clearly trying not to laugh at you.)~
@1754 = ~Must you insist on being underfoot constantly?~
@1755 = ~Turn your eyes elsewhere.~
@1756 = ~(The smile Sarevok offers in return is cold and malicious, but there is fiery passion in his dark eyes.)~
@1757 = ~(After sticking out your tongue and crossing your eyes, you refocus and realize that Sarevok has moved to stand directly in front of you, a disapproving scowl on his face.)~
@1758 = ~Are you finished making a fool of yourself?~
@1759 = ~(Only seconds pass before Sarevok clears the distance between you, grabs your chin firmly in one hand, and plants a ravening kiss on your lips. The two of you grapple for dominance, but it's hard to decide who is the victor when necessity forces you to break apart, panting, flushed, and utterly dissatisfied.)~
@1760 = ~A loaded question if I ever heard one.~
@1761 = ~(Sarevok is a handsome man, but his eyes are cold and unsympathetic. Not surprising considering he can snap a man's neck with his bare hands without a second thought.)~
@1762 = ~(Sarevok's dark eyes are hooded in shadows, so very different from the golden glow he had when the taint flowed through his blood. Oddly enough, he seems even more menacing now.)~
@1763 = ~(Just as you move to get a better angle, Sarevok turns to you as if to speak, and immediately notices where your attention was focused. He smirks knowingly, then moves around the back of you, eyeing your bottom with a lustful grin that puts your own efforts to shame.)~
@1764 = ~Will you be grinning like a loon on your deathbed as well?~
@1765 = ~(Sarevok offers you a dark smile in return.)~
@1766 = ~There are better ways to test my reflexes, <CHARNAME>.~
@1767 = ~(Your hand comes to rest briefly on Sarevok's forearm, but he does not acknowledge you as his eyes dart from shadow the shadow, searching for any threat.)~
@1768 = ~(Sarevok moves toward you as you reach for him, so instead of touching his shoulder you end up caressing the back of his neck. He raises an eyebrow at you, then dips forward as if to kiss you, but instead nips your bottom lip, chuckling at the indignant look on your face.)~
@1769 = ~(As your hand rests on Sarevok's chest, he looks down at you with a wary expression.)~
@1770 = ~What do you want?~
@1771 = ~(You reach up to gently caress Sarevok's jaw with your fingertips. His muscles twitch under your touch as you feel the rough stubble and warm skin underneath, and after only a few seconds he brushes off your hand with a frown.)~
@1772 = ~I am not your pet.~
@1773 = ~(Sarevok's hands freeze and he goes very still for several seconds, but suddenly he is on his feet, your hands now captured behind your back in one of his as he pins you against his chest. His other hand delves into your hair, pulling insistently until you expose your throat to his eager lips and teeth.)~
@1774 = ~(Still holding you trapped against him, he bites at your collarbone, then pulls away to stare down at you, a predatory gleam in his dark eyes.)~
@1775 = ~It is dangerous to tease me, woman.~
@1776 = ~(Sarevok shakes his head and stalks away.)~
@1777 = ~Your sincerity is overwhelming.~
@1778 = ~(Instead of meeting the ground, however, you feel strong arms catch you mid-fall. Sarevok takes advantage of the opportunity to demand a rough kiss from you and grope your backside before he straightens you and keeps walking as if nothing happened.)~
@1779 = ~(Sarevok sighs and pulls you to your feet so roughly that you nearly fall again.)~
@1780 = ~I should be grateful you are not this clumsy in bed.~
@1781 = ~I swear you are doing this on purpose...~
@1782 = ~Are you so desperate to touch me?~
@1783 = ~(You catch Sarevok during a very rare moment when he is not wearing armor. Your arms slide easily around his waist and you can feel his body heat through his shirt. After a moment of hesitation, he returns the embrace, curling his powerful arms around your body. His voice is low and husky against your ear.)~
@1784 = ~Perhaps you should call an early rest.~
@1785 = ~(Sarevok sighs but stands completely still as you wrap your arms around him. When you eventually withdraw, he is frowning irritably.)~
@1786 = ~(He blinks when he realizes that you are not an enemy, and though his crushing grip relaxes, he does not completely release you.)~
@1787 = ~Do you wish to test me? Perhaps you are thrilled by the danger. Do what you will, <CHARNAME>, but do not haunt me if I accidentally kill you because of your foolish games.~
@1788 = ~(Sarevok's lips are warm and dry as you press a kiss against them. He does not respond, but when you pull away he gives you a bemused look.)~
@1789 = ~What would Gorion say if he could see you now, I wonder...~
@1790 = ~(Then, just as suddenly, he pulls back from you. Though his eyes are dark with desire, Sarevok flashes you an evil grin before walking away.)~
@1791 = ~I am not your plaything, <CHARNAME>.~
@1792 = ~(Sarevok is staring off into the distance, but his focus snaps to your face as soon as you approach. When you try to lean in to kiss him, he pushes you away, his eyes dark and unreadable as he shakes his head.)~
@1793 = ~(During a brief rest, you take the opportunity to slide your fingers beneath the collar of Sarevok's breastplate in an attempt to relax his rock-hard shoulders. There's little room in there to do any actual good, and after a moment, Sarevok scowls and moves away from your touch.)~
@1794 = ~(When you finish your ministrations, Sarevok catches you by the arm and draws you onto his lap, sealing your lips with a hard, demanding kiss.)~
@1795 = ~You must want something from me.~
@1796 = ~(You spend several minutes working the knots and tension from Sarevok's back, and listening to his appreciative groans. When you finish, he turns you around and returns the favor, his fingers strong and skilled against the aches and pains of your back.)~
@1797 = ~Stop distracting me.~
@1798 = ~(The moment you raise the cloth to his face, Sarevok snorts and steps away from you.) I do not need to be mothered, <CHARNAME>.~
@1799 = ~You are a distraction.~
@1800 = ~(Sarevok stares at you passively for a moment, then shakes his head with a mocking sneer.) Must I truly point out that I am wearing armor and cannot feel your touch?~
@1801 = ~(Sarevok pulls irritably away from your touch.) Not now.~
@1802 = ~(Sarevok says nothing as you lean in to whisper something suggestive in his ear, but you cannot help but notice the glint of desire in his eyes.)~
@1803 = ~(Your plans are foiled when you feel a sharp pain on your hand - a pointed ridge on Sarevok's armor catches you as you brush past and draws a painful welt across your skin. With a mocking laugh, Sarevok shakes his head and walks past you.)~
@1804 = ~And what possible motive could you have for such a statement?~
@1805 = ~None. It was simply an observation.~
@1806 = ~Oh, I don't know...perhaps it has something to do with how cold my bedroll is at night...~
@1807 = ~I need a motive to pay you a compliment?~
@1808 = ~Forget I said anything.~
@1809 = ~You are a fool to waste such words on me. A brazen fool, but a fool nonetheless.~
@1810 = ~It's foolish to find you attractive?~
@1811 = ~You really like using that word, don't you?~
@1812 = ~What are you scared of, Sarevok?~
@1813 = ~Insult me if you must, but I think it's just your way of hiding your attraction for me.~
@1814 = ~But it suits you so well.~
@1815 = ~Unless you are a much different person than I have judged you to be, then there is only one possible motive for you to try to wear down my defenses. I warn you right now, dear sister - I am not the kind of fool to be led around by his codpiece, and I will not give you the chance for revenge.~
@1816 = ~Then I *am* a different person than you've judged me to be.~
@1817 = ~Of course you aren't. That is precisely why I find you attractive.~
@1818 = ~Hah, bold words, but all men can be broken.~
@1819 = ~Revenge is the only motive you can think of? Then it seems your experience with women is somewhat limited.~
@1820 = ~If you insist, but find some desperate whelp to sell your charms to. I am not interested.~
@1821 = ~And if you believe insulting my pride will win me over, then you know nothing of men.~
@1822 = ~Because I'm curious?~
@1823 = ~Because I asked you.~
@1824 = ~Just answer the question.~
@1825 = ~(sigh) Forget it.~
@1826 = ~If you must know, I am not certain, just as you likely do not know the exact day of your birth.~
@1827 = ~A guess then.~
@1828 = ~Wasn't there a day you celebrated as your birthday, though?~
@1829 = ~Do you think Rieltar the kind of man to throw me a grand celebration?~
@1830 = ~I am several years older than you, so make of that what you will.~
@1831 = ~You have an astounding talent for stating the obvious.~
@1832 = ~Was that sarcasm?~
@1833 = ~I'm just curious why they don't glow anymore.~
@1834 = ~Can't you just answer a question without being difficult?~
@1835 = ~Is it because you don't have the taint anymore?~
@1836 = ~I am unsure. Was it?~
@1837 = ~I'm going to go with ‘yes.'~
@1838 = ~Then you are as perceptive as you are observant.~
@1839 = ~I was unaware that your statement was actually intended as a question.~
@1840 = ~Well...it was.~
@1841 = ~Forget it. I don't even care anymore.~
@1842 = ~It is obviously due to the loss of Bhaal's taint. Truthfully, I hardly miss it. I...could not control it at times, and it often revealed much more than I wished.~
@1843 = ~Yeah, because the evil laugh and spiked armor and giant sword didn't reveal *anything*, right?~
@1844 = ~I could see how that would be annoying.~
@1845 = ~Oh, I don't know. I thought it was pretty interesting. It was a good look for you.~
@1846 = ~I've always been a bit jealous, to be honest. You got the neat, glowing eyes - all I got was the Slayer.~
@1847 = ~You mean it revealed your emotions?~
@1848 = ~Clever.~
@1849 = ~(snort) If you say so.~
@1850 = ~Yes. Usually anger.~
@1851 = ~‘Usually'? So...what other emotions made your eyes glow?~
@1852 = ~I've always been a bit jealous, to be honest. You got the neat, glowing eyes – all I got the Slayer…~
@1853 = ~Fascinating.~
@1854 = ~I don't think my delicate little sister could handle the answer to that. We should keep moving.~
@1855 = ~Which one?~
@1856 = ~That one on your cheek.~
@1857 = ~There, on your shoulder.~
@1858 = ~That especially nasty one on your back. Gods, how is it that you still have skin after all the punishment your back has taken?~
@1859 = ~That one there by your navel. It looks as though it travels toward a rather intimate region...~
@1860 = ~A drunken knife fight. A half-dozen arrogant fools thought me an easy target. They were wrong.~
@1861 = ~You sound proud of yourself.~
@1862 = ~So you killed or beat the hells out of men likely half your size? Congratulations.~
@1863 = ~Ah, the wonders of alcohol.~
@1864 = ~Sounds like fun.~
@1865 = ~I was merely stating the facts.~
@1866 = ~The things we do to pass the time.~
@1867 = ~What of you, dear sister? Have you had any and fights that left their mark?~
@1868 = ~Oh, I've seen my share of bar brawls.  This particular fight had nothing to do with me, but I still took a dagger to the ribs. (You lift the edge of your shirt to show the faded puncture wound on your side.)~
@1869 = ~I have my share of scars from bar brawls and otherwise. Seems inevitable for people like us.~
@1870 = ~I don't scar. I get injured, but the marks always fade away.~
@1871 = ~Enough idle chatter.  We should get moving.~
@1872 = ~One would think you would have learned to recognize your own handiwork by now.~
@1873 = ~Ah. For what it's worth, I'm sorry.~
@1874 = ~I *did* recognize it.~
@1875 = ~Sarevok, I've put my mark on so many people that their faces all run together in my mind. You're no more important than any other.~
@1876 = ~Forget I asked.~
@1877 = ~Save your pity for another.~
@1878 = ~It's not pity. I really am sorry.~
@1879 = ~Sensitive subject, eh?~
@1880 = ~Bragging?~
@1881 = ~Yep.~
@1882 = ~Well...maybe just a little.~
@1883 = ~Not at all.~
@1884 = ~You know what, forget I said anything.~
@1885 = ~Is there a reason you came over here?~
@1886 = ~Look, if it makes you feel better, you left your share of marks on me as well.  Like this one. (You ease one side of your pants off your hip to reveal a long, aging scar.)~
@1887 = ~Perhaps it doesn't help to hear, but you left your share of marks on me as well.~
@1888 = ~If I could scar, you would have left plenty on me.~
@1889 = ~You're such an ass. Forget I said anything.~
@1890 = ~My foster father was not as kind as yours, dear sister. While your beloved Gorion would likely make you sit in the corner as punishment, Rieltar would have me chained and whipped for my mistakes.~
@1891 = ~Gods...I'm sorry, Sarevok.~
@1892 = ~Gorion was no pushover, but I cannot imagine...it explains much about you, though.~
@1893 = ~Well, he's dead now, so it doesn't matter much anymore.~
@1894 = ~Hah, I'm pretty sure Gorion would say he should have taken a firmer hand with me.~
@1895 = ~I do not need your pity.~
@1896 = ~It's not pity. It's sympathy.~
@1897 = ~I didn't mean to upset you.~
@1898 = ~Why do I bother? Forget I said anything.~
@1899 = ~Does it? No, say no more. I have no desire to hear your theories.~
@1900 = ~I...perhaps you are correct.~
@1901 = ~Did you come over here just to compare our childhood years, then?~
@1902 = ~My foster father may not have been a monster, but I have seen my share of torture. (You loosen the collar of your shirt and bare part of your chest, revealing only a portion of the myriad of scars you received at the hands of a certain blue-eyed mage.)~
@1903 = ~Although Gorion was a good man, my life has not been easy. I have seen my share of torture, and my body bears the scars just as yours does.~
@1904 = ~I have seen my share - and more - of torture, though my body bears no scars, no matter how grave the wound.~
@1905 = ~Nevermind. Forget I said anything.~
@1906 = ~Nosey wench. If you must know, an angry whore was adamant I had shorted her on coin.~
@1907 = ~A...whore?~
@1908 = ~Sounds like you got what was coming to you.~
@1909 = ~Did you short her?~
@1910 = ~Hah! Sounds like a girl I'd get along with.~
@1911 = ~Does that offend your delicate sensibilities, my dear sister?~
@1912 = ~Of course it does! That's disgusting!~
@1913 = ~A little...you never know where those women have been.~
@1914 = ~No, I'm just shocked that a woman who sells herself was able to outmaneuver you with a weapon.~
@1915 = ~I don't want to talk about this anymore.~
@1916 = ~They have their uses, believe me.~
@1917 = ~She was...very limber.~
@1918 = ~So did she.~
@1919 = ~Why so much interest in my private affairs, <CHARNAME>?~
@1920 = ~I certainly have my share of bedroom battle scars. (You tilt your head to the side and push your shirt off your shoulder to show him the small but deep scar.) Fell out of bed and right onto his weapon belt. Very graceful.~
@1921 = ~My private life has left me with my share of scars as well, not all of them physical. I daresay you understand that feeling as well.~
@1922 = ~My skin does not scar, but I have my share of wounds...on the inside.~
@1923 = ~Interest? Enough of this. We should get moving.~
@1924 = ~(Sarevok leans in close to see the scar, near enough to feel the heat of his body. After a moment, he raises his hand to touch the mar on your skin.)~
@1925 = ~(Stay still and let him touch you.)~
@1926 = ~(Jerk away before his hand gets near.)~
@1927 = ~Only as much as you were looking for an excuse to show me your body.~
@1928 = ~(His fingers are rough and callused against your sensitive skin, but his touch is gentle as his intense eyes hold your gaze.) Careful. A sister should not look at her brother like that.~
@1929 = ~And a brother should not touch his sister like that.~
@1930 = ~Like what?~
@1931 = ~You are not my brother.~
@1932 = ~(Lean closer to him, your faces only inches apart.)~
@1933 = ~(Pull away from him and hastily rearrange your clothes.)~
@1934 = ~You don't seem to mind.~
@1935 = ~Do not play coy.~
@1936 = ~(There is an uncharacteristic flash of uncertainty in his eyes, but he seems to realize himself and pulls away from you.) Do not play games with me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1937 = ~Ah, so you believe we have something in common then? You know nothing about me, sister.~
@1938 = ~Your skin does not scar? Then what do you have to remind you of your mistakes? No, never mind. Let us move on, <CHARNAME>.~
@1939 = ~(Sarevok looks amused and even chuckles darkly under his breath as he steps away from you.) Did I frighten you, little one? Come, sister, we should move on.~
@1940 = ~Nothing but a ruin now. Still...I wonder what will become of it.~
@1941 = ~Hopefully it will be forgotten and swallowed by the forest. It teems with evil.~
@1942 = ~Probably continue to rot away.~
@1943 = ~You sound almost sad.~
@1944 = ~It's just a rotting temple. Who cares what happens to it?~
@1945 = ~That is not what I saw.~
@1946 = ~Perhaps I am.~
@1947 = ~Think of it, <CHARNAME>. What power must there have been within those walls? Bhaal wielded such authority that hundreds, perhaps thousands of sacrifices were made on that very altar. His priests worshipped him without question, carrying out murder proudly in his name!~
@1948 = ~That's horrid! Evil will always be overthrown, Sarevok!~
@1949 = ~Bhaal wasted his power on evil, selfish pursuits. Perhaps that is the true nature of what led to his downfall.~
@1950 = ~He couldn't have been the Lord of Murder forever, Sarevok. Everything ends.~
@1951 = ~It's kind of creepy that you're so excited about it...~
@1952 = ~Bhaal was greedy. He wanted too much, too quickly...a concept you are probably all too familiar with.~
@1953 = ~If Bhaal was so great, how was he overthrown by a mad fool like Cyric?~
@1954 = ~Come. I tire of this conversation.~
@1955 = ~Bah! Not everything is so black and white, fool, and you place too much importance on good and evil. It is the *power* that matters.~
@1956 = ~Your theory implies that kind, benevolent gods are never overthrown - which is untrue.~
@1957 = ~Perhaps that is my point.~
@1958 = ~Does not the vastness of his former power excite you at all? His blood flows in *your* veins.~
@1959 = ~Even madmen get lucky, <CHARNAME>.~
@1960 = ~All of that might, all of that power, is now nothing but a ruin. That pile of rubble will be consumed by the forest and no one will remember the strength of Bhaal's might.~
@1961 = ~That's not entirely accurate. This was just a shell to house Bhaal's power, a symbol perhaps, but nothing more than that. The power belonged solely to Bhaal, and now lies in his Children.~
@1962 = ~It is right that this place be forgotten! If only all of Bhaal's depravity would so readily fade away.~
@1963 = ~Perhaps. I don't see why that is such a bad thing, though. Change is a natural part of life.~
@1964 = ~I makes me a little sad when you put it that way.~
@1965 = ~Why in the Nine Hells are we standing here talking about some broken, forgotten temple? Unlike that place, I have a future ahead of me, one that is filled with power!~
@1966 = ~With its power taken away, with Bhaal's death, the temple faded to a broken, wasted shell of its former glory. Now it is nothing but a fading shadow...~
@1967 = ~Oh, I understand now. You're not actually talking about the temple - you're talking about yourself.~
@1968 = ~I...this conversation is pointless. Get moving.~
@1969 = ~I don't know, really. The air is so thick with hate and depravity that I should be glad to see this evil place fade away.~
@1970 = ~While change is a natural part of life, that does not mean it isn't painful or sad, Sarevok.~
@1971 = ~I'm sad to know that we're standing around here talking about some pile of rubble when I could be out there taking hold of my destiny!~
@1972 = ~You are part of that ‘depravity,' dear sister. Do you wish to fade away as well? No, do not answer, just...think on it, <CHARNAME>.~
@1973 = ~Not all change is natural, <CHARNAME>, and you are a fool if you think otherwise.~
@1974 = ~Hah! You are an echo of myself from not long ago.~
@1975 = ~In my youth, I learned to play, yes. Why do you ask?~
@1976 = ~Care for a match?~
@1977 = ~Just curious is all.~
@1978 = ~You don't strike me as...patient enough for chess.~
@1979 = ~No reason.~
@1980 = ~It is an excellent exercise in simulated war strategy, something I always found worthwhile.~
@1981 = ~That makes sense. Let's get going.~
@1982 = ~Whatever you say. Let's go.~
@1983 = ~You have a chess set?~
@1984 = ~No, but I'm sure Cespenar could get one.~
@1985 = ~No, I don't...forget I mentioned it.~
@1986 = ~If that is what you want then, I would not be against the idea.~
@1987 = ~(Play chess.)~
@1988 = ~Maybe some other time.~
@1989 = ~It's a waste of time. Forget I mentioned it.~
@1990 = ~(After a few moves it becomes clear that Sarevok will defeat you handily.)~
@1991 = ~(Enjoy the challenge and continue to play.)~
@1992 = ~(Sigh and stand up.) Forget it. This is boring.~
@1993 = ~You must be cheating...~
@1994 = ~Checkmate. Not terrible, <CHARNAME>, but you have much to learn of strategy.~
@1995 = ~Will you play again with me sometime?~
@1996 = ~Are you up for being my teacher...?~
@1997 = ~Yeah, whatever. Let's go.~
@1998 = ~Hah, I do not have to cheat to beat you.~
@1999 = ~You would be wise to focus on less frivolous things instead.~
@2000 = ~A bold suggestion.~
@2001 = ~(The match is very close, and you manage to stump each other several times, stretching the game on for quite a long time.)~
@2002 = ~(Shift your position to give Sarevok a nice view of your cleavage, hoping to distract him.)~
@2003 = ~You're pretty good at this.~
@2004 = ~Okay, I'm bored now. Let's go.~
@2005 = ~Bah, you win. An impressive match, <CHARNAME>.~
@2006 = ~Yes, good game. I wouldn't mind playing again when we have to time.~
@2007 = ~Care to play again sometime?~
@2008 = ~Hah, of course I won! I always win against you.~
@2009 = ~Thanks for the match. Let's get going.~
@2010 = ~Checkmate. Even so, well played, <CHARNAME>.~
@2011 = ~Pfft, you must have been cheating. I always win against you.~
@2012 = ~(You ploy is successful, and while Sarevok's eyes take in the sights, you manage to play around his defenses.)~
@2013 = ~An intriguing tactic, but you will not distract me so easily.~
@2014 = ~And you are trying to distract me.~
@2015 = ~Enough of this waste of time.~
@2016 = ~(After a few moves it becomes clear that you will handily defeat Sarevok.)~
@2017 = ~(Trounce him as quickly as possible.)~
@2018 = ~(Draw the match out, making sure to keep one step ahead of him so that you beat him in the end.)~
@2019 = ~(Draw the match out and let him win.)~
@2020 = ~Forget it - you're no match for me. Let's go.~
@2021 = ~Impressive.~
@2022 = ~I know I am. Still I wouldn't mind playing with you again some time.~
@2023 = ~I got lucky - you played well. Care to play again sometime?~
@2024 = ~You could use some lessons in strategy, Sarevok. I wouldn't mind being your...teacher.~
@2025 = ~You're a fool to think you could have beaten me.~
@2026 = ~We've wasted enough time. Let's go.~
@2027 = ~That was *not* Tamoko. So there is nothing to discuss.~
@2028 = ~Perhaps not, but the things that Gorion-wraith creature said to me still hurt.~
@2029 = ~No it wasn't, but it still couldn't have been pleasant for you to hear those things.~
@2030 = ~Maybe it wasn't, but the things she said had to have come from somewhere.~
@2031 = ~Do you deny the things she - that creature - said about you?~
@2032 = ~How can you be so sure?~
@2033 = ~Okay...if you're certain you don't want to talk...~
@2034 = ~Just go away.~
@2035 = ~What would you have me say to that, <CHARNAME>? Do you think I care one whit about your pain?~
@2036 = ~It's called 'commiserating' Sarevok. We have a painful experience in common, and so we talk to each other about it. Help each other.~
@2037 = ~This isn't about my pain, Sarevok, it's about yours. Those things she said had to have come from somewhere.~
@2038 = ~No, I don't suppose you do.~
@2039 = ~Will you tell me about her?~
@2040 = ~I didn't kill her, you know.~
@2041 = ~She died well, Sarevok.~
@2042 = ~I was happy to put her out of her misery. She died slowly, Sarevok, and with your name on her lips.~
@2043 = ~(sigh) Forget I brought this up.~
@2044 = ~None of what the creature said matters in the least. Why are you bothering me?~
@2045 = ~The things she said had to have come from somewhere.~
@2046 = ~What are you trying to say?~
@2047 = ~That it plagues you, wondering what she would say to you now. That you cannot stop wondering what might have been. That a part of you will always feel guilty, and...~
@2048 = ~That what she said came from your mind. Your fears.~
@2049 = ~I'm not trying to say anything, Sarevok. I just want to help you if I can.~
@2050 = ~Deny them? No. How can I? I...~
@2051 = ~Leave me be, <CHARNAME>.~
@2052 = ~You have to be hurting. I want to help you if I can.~
@2053 = ~Those creatures were drawn there by the evil that still lingered in Bhaal's Temple. They were nothing more than shades, shadows of reality.~
@2054 = ~And...I would know Tamoko. That was *not* her.~
@2055 = ~Do you want to talk about it?~
@2056 = ~Do you believe that we have something in common, fool? That we have somehow 'shared' this traumatic experience?~
@2057 = ~You...?~
@2058 = ~Why do you tell me this?~
@2059 = ~I don't know. I just thought you would want to know.~
@2060 = ~She loved you, Sarevok. Even I could see that much.~
@2061 = ~Because I wish I had killed her. I wonder if she would have died with your name on her lips.~
@2062 = ~To hurt you. To remind you that it was your cruel whim that sent her to her death.~
@2063 = ~Because I wish I hadn't had to kill her, Sarevok. She left me no choice.~
@2064 = ~You wretched harpy! Why do you tell me this?!~
@2065 = ~I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.~
@2066 = ~You need to face your guilt, Sarevok. You need to own up to what you've done!~
@2067 = ~She loved you, Sarevok. Even I could see that much, and you just threw her away!~
@2068 = ~I wish I hadn't had to kill her, but you left her no choice!~
@2069 = ~Get away from me, fool, before I send you to join her!~
@2070 = ~And you think I don't already know this?!~
@2071 = ~Do you wish me to turn the tables on you? Should I recite what Gorion's shade said to you? Shove your own doubts in your face? Remind you of the things he called you?~
@2072 = ~I will not speak of this with you! Away from me!~
@2073 = ~You talk in your sleep.~
@2074 = ~I do?~
@2075 = ~Great. What did I say?~
@2076 = ~I most certainly do not.~
@2077 = ~That's not surprising considering the content of most of my dreams.~
@2078 = ~You were thrashing like a madwoman during my watch. I thought to try to wake you, but I feared I might lose an eye. And you said a name. Irenicus.~
@2079 = ~(Turn your face away so he doesn't see the pain in your eyes.)~
@2080 = ~(sigh) I can't escape him, even now.~
@2081 = ~Do not say that name! Ever!~
@2082 = ~(Blink away tears as memories of sharp knives and cruel hands flit through your mind.)~
@2083 = ~I don't want to talk about him.~
@2084 = ~(Sarevok stops you, tilting your chin upward so he can study your face with a calculating frown.)~
@2085 = ~(Sarevok seems annoyed by your reaction and scowls fiercely.)~
@2086 = ~I remember this man's name, and that he had done something...or...taken something from you. Tell me.~
@2087 = ~I...no, I'm sorry, I can't...it's still too hard...~
@2088 = ~I suppose I can try...~
@2089 = ~Tell you what? That he was a cruel bastard who tortured me relentlessly? That he stole my soul and left me to be devoured by the taint? That I can't stop seeing him in my dreams no matter what I try?~
@2090 = ~What exactly do you want to know, Sarevok?~
@2091 = ~I've gotten over it, but I can tell you the tale if you wish to hear it.~
@2092 = ~No. It's in the past, and it doesn't matter anymore.~
@2093 = ~Bah, must you always be so difficult? Then assure me of this, at least. Will this man who haunts your dreams be showing up to get in our way someday?~
@2094 = ~He's dead. So unless he finds a way back, then no. Although...*you* found a way back...~
@2095 = ~No. And if he does, I'll just kill him again.~
@2096 = ~That's not your concern.~
@2097 = ~Just drop it already!~
@2098 = ~Hah, I am but one out of hundreds of thousands who stay dead. I doubt he will be so fortunate.~
@2099 = ~Then he is dead? Good.~
@2100 = ~Tell me everything.~
@2101 = ~I...no, I'm sorry, I thought I could...but it's still too hard...~
@2102 = ~Okay, but I warn you, this is a long story. Shortly after we defeated you, we were ambushed and captured. We had no idea who they were, but they took us to an underground dungeon, and that is where I first met Jon Irenicus...~
@2103 = ~I'll try to give you the abridged version. I woke up in a cell, deep in a dungeon. I don't remember how I got there, but my abductor's name was Jon Irenicus. We escaped and found that somehow we'd ended up in Amn...~
@2104 = ~Let me give you the basic facts. A madman who wanted my soul took me captive. Jon Irenicus. He tortured me, tortured Imoen. Eventually he got what he was after, but he couldn't hold on to my soul for long.~
@2105 = ~Never mind...this isn't your concern. Let's go.~
@2106 = ~(Sarevok's eyes are fixed on the ground as he listens, but his face is determined and thoughtful by turns as he absorbs the long, winding tale of your experiences in Amn. It isn't until you begin to explain that Irenicus was after your soul, and the means by which he managed to take it from you that he interrupts.)~
@2107 = ~Your soul? Yes...I remember...you sought the Tears of Bhaal. *That* is why his name is familiar to me, though I can recall only fragments.~
@2108 = ~What did he want with your soul?~
@2109 = ~You don't know?~
@2110 = ~He took it to fill a great void within himself. A void which was not entirely his fault.~
@2111 = ~He was greedy for power. He wanted to be a god.~
@2112 = ~Irenicus was a madman. His reasons were so twisted and evil that I cannot fathom them.~
@2113 = ~Does it matter? When someone takes something precious from you, does it matter *why*?~
@2114 = ~I...I don't think I can talk about this anymore...it's still too hard...~
@2115 = ~As I said, I remember little of our confrontation. I have only this nagging feeling that there are things I should know.~
@2116 = ~He wanted my soul to fill a great void within himself. A void which was not entirely his fault.~
@2117 = ~Irenicus was a madman - his reasons were so twisted and evil that I cannot fathom them.~
@2118 = ~Does it matter what he wanted the soul for? When someone takes something precious from you, does it matter *why*?~
@2119 = ~What do you mean?~
@2120 = ~Jon was an elf. A greedy, sadistic elf, but an elf nonetheless. He did vile and terrible things, and so his people severed his ties to the Spirit and cast him out. In essence, they *created* him, the twisted, empty shell of a man that I was forced to endure.~
@2121 = ~He committed unspeakable crimes, and so his people stripped him of everything, including his ability to feel, and cast him out into the world with nothing.~
@2122 = ~His lover was too much of a coward to do what was necessary. Instead of slaying him as she should have for the crimes he committed, she showed 'mercy' and cast him out instead! Her foolishness cost me much.~
@2123 = ~Never mind. Does it matter what he wanted the soul for? When someone takes something precious from you, does it matter *why*?~
@2124 = ~And he believed he could achieve that goal with your soul? Ambitious.~
@2125 = ~Perhaps so, but if he managed to steal your soul then he was obviously much more than a simple madman.~
@2126 = ~No, it does not.~
@2127 = ~An elf? I see. And he was strong enough to have survived being severed from the Spirit?~
@2128 = ~Yes, but I cannot imagine how. It is a fate far worse than death for my people.~
@2129 = ~In many ways, he didn't survive.~
@2130 = ~Death would have been a better option.~
@2131 = ~I wish the foul wretch had died! I would have been saved from much pain and torment.~
@2132 = ~It sounds like this 'mercy' was nothing more than cowardice.~
@2133 = ~What was his true purpose, though? Power? Greed? Revenge?~
@2134 = ~Revenge. More than anything, he seemed to crave the suffering of everyone who had ever wronged him.~
@2135 = ~Although he masked his intentions under the banner of vengeance, I believe he was always seeking power for himself.~
@2136 = ~I truly don't know. He is as much a mystery to me now as he was when he first captured me.~
@2137 = ~What does it matter? He will never bother me again.~
@2138 = ~Yes...that I can understand.~
@2139 = ~And this man, this Irenicus, where is he now?~
@2140 = ~Dead.~
@2141 = ~Hopefully rotting in his own private hell.~
@2142 = ~I had no choice but to slay him. I had to take my soul back.~
@2143 = ~He is long dead, and I have gotten over the things he did to me. He cannot hurt me anymore.~
@2144 = ~I certainly hope that is not guilt I hear in your voice.~
@2145 = ~An astounding tale, to be sure. All the more amazing by the fact that you not only survived, not only recovered your stolen soul, but that you have grown stronger from the experience. And you now have the Slayer at your disposal. It seems to me your suffering at this man's hands was worth bearing.~
@2146 = ~I am glad you told me this. We should get moving.~
@2147 = ~(Sarevok seems startled by your reaction and shifts his weight awkwardly.)~
@2148 = ~I remember this man's name, and that he had done something...or...taken something from you. Will you tell me?~
@2149 = ~As you wish, but assure me of this one thing. This man who haunts your dreams, will he someday cross your path again?~
@2150 = ~Hah, I am but one out of hundreds of thousands who actually stay dead. I doubt he will be so fortunate.~
@2151 = ~(Sarevok listens with rapt attention, his eyes rarely leaving your face as he absorbs the long, winding tale of your experiences in Amn. It isn't until you begin to explain that Irenicus was after your soul, and the means by which he managed to take it from you that he interrupts.)~
@2152 = ~And he believed he could achieve that goal with your soul? I see.~
@2153 = ~I suppose not.~
@2154 = ~An elf? I cannot see how he could even have survived being severed from the Spirit.~
@2155 = ~Neither can I. It is a fate far worse than death for my people.~
@2156 = ~Yes...I understand.~
@2157 = ~An astounding tale, to be sure. All the more amazing by the fact that you not only survived, not only recovered your stolen soul, but that you have grown stronger from the experience.~
@2158 = ~Thank you for telling me this. We should get moving.~
@2159 = ~Oh come on, tell me.~
@2160 = ~Afraid to relive it?~
@2161 = ~Was it that bad?~
@2162 = ~Fine, forget I said anything.~
@2163 = ~I already have.~
@2164 = ~Is that a serious question?~
@2165 = ~What reason could you possibly have for asking me about this?~
@2166 = ~I'm just curious I guess.~
@2167 = ~I want to hear how much you suffered, Sarevok. I want to know if it was even half as much as I suffered thanks to you.~
@2168 = ~It just doesn't seem to have done you much good, so I'm wondering if it was really all that horrible.~
@2169 = ~You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.~
@2170 = ~Then your curiosity will have to go unsatisfied. I will not speak of this even to you.~
@2171 = ~Hah! Take comfort in this one thing, <CHARNAME>. We both grew stronger for our suffering.~
@2172 = ~You expected torment to improve my personality? Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.~
@2173 = ~No. I don't.~
@2174 = ~What kind of foolish question is that?~
@2175 = ~What's so foolish about it?~
@2176 = ~Is there anything you *don't* consider foolish?~
@2177 = ~You don't want to tell me.~
@2178 = ~Forget it.~
@2179 = ~Gladly.~
@2180 = ~In regards to your inscesant questions? No.~
@2181 = ~If you must know and truly cannot guess for youself, then yes, I do feel different now.~
@2182 = ~How?~
@2183 = ~Elaborate.~
@2184 = ~What a truly prolific reply.~
@2185 = ~Never mind. I don't care anyway.~
@2186 = ~My thoughts are more my own now. That is all I will say.~
@2187 = ~You're very fortunate. You have a second chance at life now, a life that's yours to command.~
@2188 = ~More your own? You must get lonely without Bhaal's booming voice in your head.~
@2189 = ~You sound almost disappointed when you say that.~
@2190 = ~Interesting.~
@2191 = ~That's great. Let's go.~
@2192 = ~So it would seem.~
@2193 = ~(sigh) Enough talk.~
@2194 = ~And if I am? I...no, never mind. Enough talk.~
@2195 = ~I am so pleased you think so.~
@2196 = ~Why do you insist on mentioning her? Are you jealous? Or do you think to torment me with reminders of her?~
@2197 = ~Honestly? I am a little jealous.~
@2198 = ~Why would I be jealous? Whatever it was you 'shared' with her ended with you sending her to her death!~
@2199 = ~I'm just curious, Sarevok. She obviously meant much to you.~
@2200 = ~I think you need to talk about her. I think it eats away at you.~
@2201 = ~Who are you to demand my reasons? I ask, and you should answer!~
@2202 = ~Maybe you should be tormented. Maybe that pain will keep you from betraying the next woman who cares for you.~
@2203 = ~Forget it. Let's go.~
@2204 = ~(snort) Then you are a fool.~
@2205 = ~I need not your reminders, fool.~
@2206 = ~Then I will answer you thus: if you dare mention her name to me again, you will make you rue the day you gave me a piece of your soul. Now get away from me.~
@2207 = ~Hah! Any woman who cares for me deserves what she gets, would you not agree?~
@2208 = ~She is dead. Nothing can change that now, and there is no point discussing her.~
@2209 = ~She was beautiful.~
@2210 = ~She seemed smart, and she had this inner strength to her that even I could see.~
@2211 = ~She wanted to save you, Sarevok. Save you from the very fate that befell you.~
@2212 = ~I suppose you're right. We can't bring back the dead.~
@2213 = ~Very well. Let's go.~
@2214 = ~I...yes. She was.~
@2215 = ~Of course she was strong. She was my equal...for a time.~
@2216 = ~You think that I do not know this?~
@2217 = ~No more than we can change the past. Come, <CHARNAME>. Enough talk.~
@2218 = ~I see what you are doing, and I will not play your game. My past is my own, and in this you have no business intruding. Leave me be.~
@2219 = ~Cythandria? Why? She was of no value.~
@2220 = ~But...you were sleeping with her! She had to have *some* value.~
@2221 = ~She was part of your life, though.~
@2222 = ~It doesn't seem like there are any women you've ever known who have any value to you.~
@2223 = ~Of course not. She seemed little more than an angry whore to me. Still, I'm curious about her.~
@2224 = ~She obviously had her uses if you kept her close to you.~
@2225 = ~Never mind. Let's get going.~
@2226 = ~There was one woman...long ago. But she is long dead.~
@2227 = ~Cythandria was there to warm my bed and support my plans. That is all.~
@2228 = ~Because Tamoko stopped supporting you.~
@2229 = ~She was pretty annoying. Tamoko was far better.~
@2230 = ~Well. Nice to know you cared about her so much.~
@2231 = ~You really are a bastard sometimes. Didn't you care about her at all?~
@2232 = ~Hah! And do you think she cared for me? No, <CHARNAME>, our partnership was honest in that regard.~
@2233 = ~Enough of her. She is dead and gone.~
@2234 = ~He did well for himself, for a madman. A pity not all of Bhaal's children share his ambition.~
@2235 = ~A yeah, a *real* pity. It would be so much better if there were hundreds of cities with deranged, power-hungry rulers.~
@2236 = ~I'm glad he's dead. To use and neglect the people of this city was cruel and unjust!~
@2237 = ~I wonder how he came to control this city. He didn't seem to be a very capable leader from what I saw.~
@2238 = ~It is a pity. Almost all of the Children I've met are weak, pathetic creatures.~
@2239 = ~He certainly had a good thing going here - control of his own city, loyal army, devoted followers.~
@2240 = ~Never mind. I don't want to talk about Gromnir.~
@2241 = ~Hah, and what then would be different? I have yet to meet a ruler of any kind who was not those things to some degree.~
@2242 = ~(snort) I do not think he shared your concerns. He *was* a fool, though, to try to hide behind city walls. They would have eventually fallen in on him even had you not come along.~
@2243 = ~It was not necessarily his leadership that gained him this position. Power follows in the wake of Bhaalspawn, and there are always many willing to take advantage of that power.~
@2244 = ~I have noticed that as well.~
@2245 = ~All of it gone now, and at the hands of another Bhaalspawn. I wonder if Bhaal knew how bloody the battles between his own Children would be.~
@2246 = ~Ah, well. Gromnir has proved one thing for certain. Ambition is not enough.~
@2247 = ~Wasn't that already proven by *you*?~
@2248 = ~I don't agree with that. It wasn't his ambition that failed him - it was his mind.~
@2249 = ~Ambition is never a good thing. It only leads to pain and suffering.~
@2250 = ~You finally figured that out, did you?~
@2251 = ~Enough chatter. Let's get going.~
@2252 = ~I had far more than ambition at my disposal. The wealth and knowledge I had at my fingertips could have toppled nations and changed history!~
@2253 = ~That worked out well for you, didn't it.~
@2254 = ~Still so arrogant, after all you've been through. Don't you ever learn?~
@2255 = ~Then why didn't it, Sarevok?~
@2256 = ~And you squandered it because you made me your enemy. Now it's my turn to call you a fool.~
@2257 = ~Perhaps, but I believe it would be accurate to say his ambitions would have failed him even had his mind been whole.~
@2258 = ~But come, enough talk of this dead fool.~
@2259 = ~Spew your righteous babble at some eager fool.~
@2260 = ~I am well aware of my own failures, <CHARNAME>. *You* should be aware that I will not make the same mistakes again.~
@2261 = ~You should not trust him, that much is clear.~
@2262 = ~Of course not. I just wondered if you had any other impressions of him.~
@2263 = ~His answers were certainly evasive.~
@2264 = ~You don't trust anyone, do you?~
@2265 = ~What's wrong with trusting him? He's given us no reason not to.~
@2266 = ~Never mind. Let's go.~
@2267 = ~No, and you will live longer if you heed these words of wisdom: trust no one.~
@2268 = ~You can only be blind for so long, <CHARNAME>. Eventually you will have to face the fact that trust is a weakness, one which can be easily exploited.~
@2269 = ~Balthazar is arrogant and self-righteous, but insecure. He has secrets. Why would he cower behind these walls if he has nothing to hide?~
@2270 = ~I agree. This is overkill for a simple monastary.~
@2271 = ~Maybe you're right.~
@2272 = ~Maybe those walls just make him feel safe.~
@2273 = ~If he's hiding something from me, we'll find a way around those walls and make him talk.~
@2274 = ~Enough chatter. Let's go.~
@2275 = ~Then he would be a fool.~
@2276 = ~Keep your guard up and do not expose any weakness to this man.~
@2277 = ~So it seems. In truth, a part of me has begun to believe that this was his biggest mistake.~
@2278 = ~Funny. I think his biggest mistake was being an evil, murdering bastard who couldn't handle losing his divinity.~
@2279 = ~Because he spread himself too thin?~
@2280 = ~It was a mistake alright. All his spawn do is fight each other constantly in huge, bloody battles!~
@2281 = ~I think Bhaal made a lot of mistakes.~
@2282 = ~I really don't give a damn about what you think, Sarevok.~
@2283 = ~Then why did you bother to ask?~
@2284 = ~Hah, those sound more like personality traits than mistakes.~
@2285 = ~Yes, exactly.~
@2286 = ~Look at the Bhaalspawn we have seen so far in our traveles. They are *weak* at best, aside from a handful that rise above the rest and survive a bit longer. If Bhaal had only produced a few heirs, I wonder if perhaps they would have been stronger.~
@2287 = ~Yes, but Bhaal did what he thought was best - spread himself out as much as possible to better his chances of returning.~
@2288 = ~But he didn't care if they were strong or not. In fact, the weaker they were, the easier it would be for him to reclaim his essence.~
@2289 = ~I don't think it would have made a difference. This taint within the Children...it's not something a mortal body can handle for very long. Eventually even the strongest will falter.~
@2290 = ~Yeah, that's great. Let's get going.~
@2291 = ~Do you? Then perhaps you are not as ignorant as you often seem. Interesting.~
@2292 = ~Yes, he did what seemed best. But I still believe it to be a flaw in his plans.~
@2293 = ~Come, we have wasted enough time on this.~
@2294 = ~Hmm...yes, that is true. A fascinating thought. I had not considered it that way before.~
@2295 = ~But come, we have wasted enough time on this.~
@2296 = ~Unless that strongest ascended. Then there would be no need for a mortal body.~
@2297 = ~Yes, and you waste time standing here ranting about it! Get moving!~
@2298 = ~Somewhat. Why do you ask?~
@2299 = ~Because I just met mine. She was not what I'd expected.~
@2300 = ~I just got the pleasure of hearing my mother describe how she was going to sacrifice me to Bhaal. It was a great way to meet her.~
@2301 = ~I'm just curious. What do you remember?~
@2302 = ~What was she like?~
@2303 = ~No, it's nothing. Let's go.~
@2304 = ~Ah, yes. She was one of Bhaal's priestesses.~
@2305 = ~Wait, you *knew*?!~
@2306 = ~How did you know that?~
@2307 = ~I don't care. I don't want to talk about this anymore.~
@2308 = ~I have no fond memories of her, <CHARNAME>. I was a product of her fanatical devotion to Bhaal, nothing more.~
@2309 = ~I know what you mean. I just met my mother, and she was not what I expected.~
@2310 = ~Well, I just got the pleasure of hearing my mother describe how she was going to sacrifice me to Bhaal. It was a great way to meet her.~
@2311 = ~Have you ever wondered what our lives would have been like without...all this?~
@2312 = ~I see. Enough talk, then. Let's go.~
@2313 = ~I have a vague memory of my time at the Temple, before the Harper raid. That includes my mother, your mother...and you.~
@2314 = ~Why didn't you ever tell me?~
@2315 = ~What do you remember?~
@2316 = ~You never asked.~
@2317 = ~I remember very little, just a blur of impressions. I could not even tell you what my mother's face looked like.~
@2318 = ~(sigh) And now I can't stop seeing mine.~
@2319 = ~It doesn't matter anyway. They're long dead.~
@2320 = ~There's no point dwelling on the past.~
@2321 = ~You are the one who brought this up. Enough of this.~
@2322 = ~There is nothing to be gained from wishing for what cannot be. Even if you do not embrace what you are, <CHARNAME>, you must at the very least accept it.~
@2323 = ~Enough of this. There is nothing to be gained from standing around here either.~
@2324 = ~Choose? I did not choose. This is what I am, what I was born to be, what I will always be.~
@2325 = ~Yes, that is something I understand well. Still, you would have been suited for any number of paths.~
@2326 = ~Even though yours is the same path that  I have chosen, I've never felt like it was my 'destiny' or anything. Besides, you would have been suited for any number of paths.~
@2327 = ~Well, it seems to me that you would have been suited for any number of paths.~
@2328 = ~I've always felt like my calling was destined as well. Still, you would have been suited for any number of paths.~
@2329 = ~You never once thought you'd want to do something else with your life?~
@2330 = ~I see. Well, let's get moving.~
@2331 = ~I tried my hand at other things - magic, thievery - but none of it felt...right. I know of no other way to explain it.~
@2332 = ~So you just picked up a really big sword one day and thought 'I've found my calling!' then?~
@2333 = ~Do you get some sick pleasure from cleaving your enemies in half?~
@2334 = ~I admit, there is something very satisfying about seeing the terror in your enemies eyes right before you take their life.~
@2335 = ~Something like that.~
@2336 = ~Hah! Indeed there is, <CHARNAME>.~
@2337 = ~Come. Our enemies await us.~
@2338 = ~Have you never felt it, <CHARNAME>? The rush of power that comes from taking down a powerful opponent? The thrill of looking down upon their battered corpse and knowing that *you* were their better?~
@2339 = ~Yes. That's exactly how I felt the day I killed you the first time.~
@2340 = ~I...no of course not!~
@2341 = ~You are such a monster!~
@2342 = ~I'm not answering that - let's go.~
@2343 = ~Do you expect to anger me with your words? No, it pleases me to hear you gained pleasure from my defeat. Perhaps there is hope for you after all.~
@2344 = ~But we have wasted enough time.~
@2345 = ~Your hesitation speaks for itself. Do not be afraid to embrace what you truly are!~
@2346 = ~Enough wasting time.~
@2347 = ~Hah, just realized that now did you, sister? Come, we should keep moving.~
@2348 = ~No. Tell me about *your* foster father.~
@2349 = ~I asked you first.~
@2350 = ~Okay...what would you like to know?~
@2351 = ~He was a good man, Sarevok.~
@2352 = ~I loved him very much, and I still miss him.~
@2353 = ~Never mind.~
@2354 = ~Well then. I am so pleased we could have this little chat.~
@2355 = ~And I answered.~
@2356 = ~No, I won't tell you about Gorion.~
@2357 = ~Okay, fine...what would you like to know?~
@2358 = ~Very well, I'll tell you. Gorion was a good man, Sarevok.~
@2359 = ~If you really want to know, I loved him very much, and I still miss him.~
@2360 = ~Such a good man that he kept you from knowing who you really were.~
@2361 = ~I hope you are not looking for sympathy when you say that to me.~
@2362 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, have you deluded yourself into believing that he denied you the truth of your heritage out of some kind desire to protect you?~
@2363 = ~No. It hurt me that he kept the truth from me, but I've forgiven him for it.~
@2364 = ~No, and I still haven't forgiven him for it.~
@2365 = ~He did the best thing he knew to do, Sarevok. Who knows what would have happened if I'd grown up *knowing* about the taint in me?~
@2366 = ~Don't you talk about him like that! He loved me, and that's more than I can say for your foster father!~
@2367 = ~I'm glad he kept the truth back from me, though I do wish he'd been able to tell me himself when the time was right.~
@2368 = ~He was a fool to keep the truth back from me! I could have grown into my power far sooner if he'd told me!~
@2369 = ~Forget I brought this up. Let's go.~
@2370 = ~A lot of good his supposed 'love' did you both. He is dead and you are still a naive fool.~
@2371 = ~Bah! He lied to you for years and you still defend his decision? He should have told you the truth. Imagine how things would have been different if you had only known!~
@2372 = ~I think things would only have been worse if he'd told me.~
@2373 = ~Maybe things would have been different, but there's no point holding a grudge over it now.~
@2374 = ~It doesn't matter.~
@2375 = ~Just shut up! You have no right to make judgements about him!~
@2376 = ~Maybe you're right. I often wonder what I would have done differently had I known the truth sooner.~
@2377 = ~Rieltar was nothing like your Gorion. He was a cruel murderer who would let no one and nothing stand in the way of his goals.~
@2378 = ~Did you hate him?~
@2379 = ~Was there nothing good about him?~
@2380 = ~And you grew up to be just like him.~
@2381 = ~I'm sorry, Sarevok.~
@2382 = ~I despised him, <CHARNAME>. His death brought me great satisfaction.~
@2383 = ~I admit, I was not unhappy to see him dead either.~
@2384 = ~If you hated him so much, why did you grow up to be just like him?~
@2385 = ~I would expect nothing less.~
@2386 = ~I...at least I had the excuse of my blood.~
@2387 = ~Save your pity.~
@2388 = ~Come. They are dead and gone and there is no point wasting time like this. We should get moving.~
@2389 = ~Hah, I would think you would be used to it by now.~
@2390 = ~How does someone get used to being hunted and hounded for crimes they didn't even commit?~
@2391 = ~It's still irritating. Why must they blame *me* for everything?~
@2392 = ~I suppose I am. Still, it is an inconvenice I could live without.~
@2393 = ~Let them come. They can continue their hunt and I will continue to cut them down. Fools.~
@2394 = ~Whatever. Let's keep going.~
@2395 = ~Yes, we are in agreement on that.~
@2396 = ~Hah! Indeed, dear sister. Indeed.~
@2397 = ~You are a Child of Bhaal. No matter your actual role in anything, you will always be to blame in the eyes of everyone else when events turn against them. Your blood condemns you.~
@2398 = ~I wish I could just give up the taint. There's nothing I wouldn't do to just be a normal person.~
@2399 = ~I refuse to believe that! If I work hard enough for the greater good, maybe people will realize that blood doesn't make a person evil - actions do.~
@2400 = ~I'm so tired of running into this everywhere I go.~
@2401 = ~True, but you'd think people would learn that they cannot hope to defeat me and stop wasting their time trying.~
@2402 = ~Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to get used to constantly cleaning their blood from my boots.~
@2403 = ~You must know that is a fool's hope.~
@2404 = ~No matter how many armies you overcome, there will always be another fool to fill the role of one who believes they can defeat you.~
@2405 = ~You must accept what you are, <CHARNAME>, and everything that goes along with it.~
@2406 = ~No! I will never accept the evil within me!~
@2407 = ~And if I don't?~
@2408 = ~I don't know, Sarevok...~
@2409 = ~I already have accepted who I am.~
@2410 = ~I love who I am, and I embrace the dark taint. You don't need to lecture me on this.~
@2411 = ~Then you weaken yourself, and I expect you will end up the same as the rest of our siblings.~
@2412 = ~Then all is well.~
@2413 = ~We should go. There is nothing to be gained standing around here.~
